SUMMARY Ms A is a pleasant 72 year old right handed woman with a history of mesothelioma that appears stable at this time and likely mild dementia most likely Alzheimer type We tactfully discussed the patient s diagnosis with her and she felt reassured We told her that this most likely was in the earlier stages of disease and she would benefit from trying Aricept She stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the Aricept so we wrote her another prescription for Aricept The patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease but our lengthy discussion expressed genuine understanding as to why her outpatient physician had reported her to DMV It was explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment She will follow up with us in the next six months and will call us if she has any problems with the Aricept She was written for Aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks and if she has no side effects which typically are GI side effects then she can go up to 10 mg a day We also reviewed with Ms A the findings for outpatient MRI which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup which included an RPR TSH and B12 were all within normal limits"

"Health1066","REASON FOR REFERRAL The patient was referred to me by Dr X of the Clinic due to concerns regarding behavioral acting out as well as encopresis This is a 90 minute initial intake completed on 10 03 2007 I met with the patient s mother individually for the entire session I reviewed with her the treatment consent form as well as the boundaries of confidentiality and she stated that she understood these concepts PRESENTING PROBLEMS Mother reported that her primary concern in regard to the patient had to do with his oppositionality She was more ambivalent regarding addressing the encopresis In regards to his oppositionality she reported that the onset of his oppositionality was approximately at 4 years of age that before that he had been a very compliant and happy child and that he has slowly worsened over time She noted that the oppositionality occurred approximately after his brother who has multiple medical problems was born At that time mother had spent 2 months back East with the brother due to his feeding issues and will have to go again next year She reported that in terms of the behaviors that he loses his temper frequently he argues with her that he defies her authority that she has to ask him many times to do things that she has to repeat instructions that he ignores her that he whines and this is when he is told to do something that he does not want to do She reported that he deliberately annoys other people that he can be angry and resentful She reported that he does not display these behaviors with the father nor does he display them at home but they are specific to her She reported that her response to him typically is that she repeats what she wants him to do many many times that eventually she gets upset She yells at him talks with him and tries to make him go and do what she wants him to do Mother also noted that she probably ignores some his misbehaviors She stated that the father tends to be more firm and more direct with him and that the father sometimes thinks that the mother is too easy on him In regards to symptoms of depression she denied symptoms of depression noting that he tends to only become unhappy when he has to do something that he does not want to do such as go to school or follow through on a command She denied any suicidal ideation She denied all symptoms of anxiety PTSD was denied ADHD symptoms were denied as were all other symptoms of psychopathology In regards to the encopresis she reported that he has always soiled he does so 2 to 3 times a day She reported that he is concerned about this issue He currently wears underwear and had a pull up She reported that he was seen at the Gastroenterology Department here several years ago and has more recently been seen at the Diseases Center seen by Dr Y reported that the last visit was several months ago that he is on MiraLax He does sit on the toilet may be 2 times a day although that is not consistent Mother believes that he is probably constipated or impacted again He refuses to eat any fiber In regards to what happens when he soils mother basically takes full responsibility She cleans and changes his underwear thinks of things that she has tried she mostly gets frustrated makes negative comments even though she knows that he really cannot help it She has never provided him with any sort of rewards because she feels that this is something he just needs to learn to do In regards to other issues she noted that he becomes frustrated quite easily especially around homework that when mother has to correct him or when he has had difficulty doing something that he becomes upset that he will cry and he will get angry Mother s response to him is that either she gets agitated and raises her voice tells him to stop etc Mother reported it is not only with homework but also with other tasks such as if he is trying to build with his LEGOs and things do not go well DEVELOPMENTAL BACKGROUND The patient was reported to be the 8 pound 12 ounce product of a planned and noncomplicated pregnancy and emergency cesarean delivery The patient presented in a breech position Mother denied the use of drugs alcohol or tobacco during the pregnancy No sleeping or eating issues were present in the perinatal period Temperament was described as easy He was described as a cuddly baby No concerns expressed regarding his developmental milestones No serious injuries reported No hospitalizations or surgeries No allergies The patient has been encopretic for all of his life He currently is taking MiraLax FAMILY BACKGROUND The patient lives with his mother who is age 37 and is primarily a homemaker but does work approximately 48 hours a month as a beautician with his father age 35 who is a police officer and also with his younger brother who is age 3 and has significant medical problems as will be noted in a moment Mother and father have been together since 1997 married in 1999 The maternal grandmother and grandfather are living and are together and live in the Central California Coast Area There is one maternal aunt age 33 and then two adopted maternal aunt and uncle age 18 and age 13 In regards to the father s side of the family the paternal grandparents are divorced Grandfather was in Arkansas grandmother lives in Dos Palos The patient does not see his grandfather Mother stated that her relationship with her child was as described that he very much stresses her out that she wishes that he was not so defiant that she finds him to be a very stressful child to deal with In regards to the relationship with the father it was reported that the father tends to leave most of the parenting over to the mother unless she specifically asks him to do something and then he will follow through and do it He will step in and back mother up in terms of parenting tell the child not to speak to his mother that way etc Mother reported that he does spend some time with the children but not as much as mother would like him to but occasionally he will go outside and do things with them The mother reported that sometimes she has a problem in interfering with his parenting that she steps in and defends The patient It was reported that mother stated that she tries the parenting technique primarily of yelling and tried time out although her description suggests that she is not doing time out correctly as he simply gets up from his time out and she does not follow through Mother reported that she and the patient are very much alike in temperament and this has made things more difficult Mother tends to be stubborn and gets angry easily also Mother reported becoming fatigued in her parenting that she lets him get away with things sometimes because she does not want to punish him all day long sometimes ignores problems that she probably should not ignore There was reported to be jealousy between The patient and his brother B B evidently has some heart problems and feeding issues and because of that tends to get more attention in terms of his medical needs and that the patient is very jealous of that attention and feels that B is favored and that he get things that The patient does not get and that there is some tension between the brothers They do play well together however The patient does tend to be somewhat intrusive gets in his space and then B will hit him Mother reported that she graduated from high school went to Community College and was an average student No learning problems Mother has a history of depression She has currently been taking 100 mg of Zoloft administered by her primary medical doctor She is not receiving counseling She has been on the medications for the last 5 years Her dosage has not been changed in a year She feels that she is getting more irritable and more angry I encouraged her to see a primary medical doctor Mother has no drug or alcohol history Father graduated from high school went to the Police Academy average student No learning problems no psychological problems no drug or alcohol problems are reported In terms of extended family maternal grandmother as well as maternal great grandfather have a history of depression Other psychiatric symptoms were denied in the family Mother reported that the marriage is generally okay that there is some arguing She reported that it was in the normal range ACADEMIC BACKGROUND The patient attends the Roosevelt Elementary School where he is in a regular first grade classroom with Mrs The patient This is in the Kingsburg Unified School District No behavior problems academic problems were reported He does not receive special education services SOCIAL HISTORY The patient was described as being able to make and keep friends but at this point in time there has been no teasing regarding smell from the encopresis He does have kids over to play at the house PREVIOUS COUNSELING Denied DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY AND IMPRESSION My impression is that the patient has a long history of constipation and impaction which has been treated medically but it would appear that the mother has not followed through consistently with the behavioral component of toilet sitting increased fiber regular medication so that the problem has likely continued She also has not used any sort of rewards as a way to encourage him in the encopresis The patient clearly qualifies for a diagnosis of disruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified and possibly oppositional defiant disorder It would appear that mother needs help in her parenting and that she tends to mostly use yelling and anger as a way and tends to repeat herself a lot and does not have a strategy for how to follow through and to deal with defiant behavior Also mother and father may not be on the same page in terms of parenting PLAN In terms of my plan I will meet with the child in the next couple of weeks I also asked the mother to bring the father in so he could be involved in the treatment also and I gave the mother a behavioral checklist to be completed by herself and the father as well as the teacher DSM IV DIAGNOSES AXIS I Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct 309 3 Encopresis without constipation

consent the patient was taken to the operating room on a hospital stretcher in the supine position After the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of appropriate monitoring equipment by Anesthesiology as well as placement of electrophysiological monitoring equipment by the Neurology team the patient was carefully turned to the prone position and placed upon the padded Jackson table with appropriate additional padding placed as needed The patient s posterior lumbosacral region was thoroughly cleansed and shaved The patient was then scrubbed prepped and draped in the usual manner After local infiltration with 1 lidocaine with 1 200 000 epinephrine solution a posterior midline skin incision was made extending from approximately L3 to the inferior aspect of the sacrum Dissection was continued in the midline to the level of the posterior fascia Self retaining retractors were placed and subsequently readjusted as needed The fascia was opened in the midline and the standard subperiosteal dissection was then carried out to expose the posterior and posterolateral elements from L3 L4 to the sacrum bilaterally with lateral exposure carried out to the lateral aspect of the transverse processes of L4 and L5 as well as the sacral alae bilaterally by completing the exposure pedicle screw fixation was carried out in the following manner Screws were placed in systematic caudal in a cranial fashion The pedicle screw entry sites were chosen using standard dorsal landmarks and fluoroscopic guidance as needed Cortical openings were created at these sites using a small burr The pedicular tracts were then preliminarily prepared using a Lenke pedicle finder They were then probed and subsequently tapped employing fluoroscopic guidance as needed Each site was under tapped and reprobed with satisfactory findings noted as above Screws in the following dimensions were placed 6 5 mm diameter screws were placed at all sites At S1 40 mm length screws were placed bilaterally At L5 40 mm length screws were placed bilaterally and at L4 40 mm length screws were placed bilaterally with findings as noted above The rod was then contoured to span from the L4 to the S1 screws on the right The distraction was placed across the L4 L5 interspace and the connections were temporarily secured Using a matchstick burr a trough was then carefully created slightly off the midline of the left lamina extending from its caudal aspect to its more cranial aspect at the foraminal level This was longitudinally oriented A transverse trough was similarly carefully created from the cranial point of the longitudinal trough out to the lateral aspect of the pars against the foraminal level that is slightly caudal to the L4 pedicle This trough was completed to the level of the ligamentum flavum using small angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs and this portion of the lamina along with the inferior L4 articular process was then removed as a unit using rongeurs and curettes The cranial aspect of the left L5 superior articular process was then removed using a small burr and angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs A superior laminotomy was performed from the left L5 lamina and flavectomy was then carried out across this region of decompression working from caudally to cranially and medially to laterally again using curettes and Kerrison rongeurs under direct visualization In this manner the left lateral aspect of the thecal sac passing left L5 spinal nerve and exiting left L4 spinal nerve along with posterolateral aspect of disk space was exposed Local epidural veins were coagulated with bipolar and divided Gelfoam was then placed in this area This process was then repeated in similar fashion thereby exposing the posterolateral aspect of the left L5 S1 disk space As noted distraction had previously been placed at L4 L5 this was released Distraction was placed across the L5 S1 interspace After completing satisfactory exposure as noted a annulotomy was made in the posterolateral left aspect of the L5 S1 disk space Intermittent neural retraction was employed with due caution afforded to the neural elements throughout the procedure The disk space was entered and diskectomy was carried out in routine fashion using pituitary rongeurs followed by the incremental sized disk space shavers as well as straight and then angled TLIF curettes to prepare the front plate Herniated portions of the disk were also removed in routine fashion The diskectomy and endplate preparation were carried out working progressively from the left towards the right aspect of the disk across the midline in routine fashion After completing this disk space preparation Gelfoam was again placed The decompression was assessed and appeared to be satisfactory The distraction was released and attention was redirected at L4 L5 where again distraction was placed and diskectomy and endplate preparation was carried out at this interspace again in similar fashion After completing the disk space preparation attention was redirected to L5 S1 Distraction was released at L4 L5 and again reapplied at L5 S1 incrementally increasing size Trial spaces were used and a 10 mm height by 26 mm length spacer was chosen A medium BMP kit was appropriately reconstituted A BMP sponge containing morcellated vertebral autograft was then placed into the anterior aspect of the disk space The spacer was then carefully impacted into position The distraction was released The spacer was checked with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted This process was then repeated in similar fashion at L4 L5 again with placement of a 10 mm height by 26 mm length Capstone spacer again containing BMP and again with initial placement of a BMP sponge with vertebral autograft anteriorly within the interspace This spacer was also checked again with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted The prior placement of the spacers and BMP the wound was thoroughly irrigated and dried with satisfactory hemostasis noted Surgicel was placed over the exposed dura and disk space The distraction was released on the right and compression plates across the L5 S1 and L4 L5 interspaces and the connections fully tightened in routine fashion The posterolateral elements on the right from L4 to S1 were prepared for fusion in routine fashion and BMP sponges with supplemental vertebral autograft was placed in the posterolateral fusion bed as well as the vertebral autograft in the dorsal aspect of the L4 L5 and L5 S1 facets on the right in a routine fashion A left sided rod was appropriated contoured and placed to span between the L4 to S1 screws Again compression was placed across the L4 L5 and L5 S1 segments and these connections were fully secured Thorough hemostasis was ascertained after checking the construct closely and fluoroscopically The wound was closed using multiple simple interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures to

consisted of four level decompression on 08 28 06 The patient continued to complain of posterior neck pain radiating to both trapezius Review of his MRI revealed the presence of what still appeared to be residual lateral recess stenosis It also raised the possibility of instability and based on this I recommended decompression and posterolateral spinal instrumention however intraoperatively it appeared like there was no abnormal movement of any of the joint segments however there was still residual stenosis since the laminectomy that was done previously was partial Based on this I did total decompression by removing the lamina of C3 through C6 and doing bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy at C3 C4 C4 C5 C5 C6 and C6 C7 with no spinal instrumentation Operation and expected outcome risks and benefits were discussed with him prior to the surgery Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection Infection can be superficial but may also extend down to the epidural space which may require return to the operating room and evacuation of the infection There is also the risk of bleeding that could be superficial but may also be in the epidural space resulting in compression of spinal cord This may result in weakness of all four extremities numbness of all four extremities and impairment of bowel and bladder function which will require an urgent return to the operating room and evacuation of the hematoma There is also the risk of a dural tear with its attendant problems of CSF leak headache nausea vomiting photophobia pseudomeningocele and dural meningitis This too may require return to the operating room for evacuation of said pseudomeningocele and repair The patient understood the risk of the surgery I told him there is just a 30 chance that there will be no improvement with the surgery he understands this and agreed to have the procedure performed DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE The patient was brought to the operating room awake alert not in any form of distress After smooth induction and intubation a Foley catheter was inserted Monitoring leads were also placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics for both SSEP and EMG monitoring The SSEPs were normal and the EMGs were silent during the entire case After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads the patient was then positioned prone on a Wilson frame with the head supported on a foam facial support Shave was then carried out over the occipital and suboccipital region All pressure points were padded I proceeded to mark the hypertrophic scar for excision This was initially cleaned with alcohol and prepped with DuraPrep After sterile drapes were laid out incision was made using a scalpel blade 10 Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to excise the hypertrophic scar Dissection was then carried down to the cervical fascia and by careful dissection to the scar tissue the spinous process of C2 was then identified There was absence of the spinous process of C3 C4 C5 and C6 but partial laminectomy was noted removal of only 15 of the lamina With this completed we proceeded to do a total laminectomy at C3 C4 C5 and C6 which was technically difficult due to the previous surgery There was also a dural tear on the right C3 C4 space that was exposed and repaired with Prolene 6 0 and later with Tisseel By careful dissection and the use of a 5 and 3 mm bur total laminectomy was done as stated with bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy done at C3 C4 C4 C5 C5 C6 and C6 C7 There was significant epidural bleeding which was carefully coagulated At two points I had to pack this with small pieces of Gelfoam After repair of the dural tear Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage Area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin and then lined with Tisseel The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 0 simple interrupted sutures to the fascia Vicryl 2 0 inverted interrupted sutures to the dermis and a running nylon 2 0 continuous vertical mattress stitch The patient was extubated and transferred to recovery"

who has had a prior decompression several weeks ago He presented several days later with headaches as well as a draining wound He was subsequently taken back for a dural repair For the last 10 to 11 days he has been okay except for the last two days he has had increasing headaches has nausea vomiting as well as positional migraines He has fullness in the back of his wound The patient s risks and benefits have been conferred him due to the fact that he does have persistent spinal leak The patient was taken to the operating room for exploration of his wound with dural repair with possible stabilization pending what we find intraoperatively PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient the patient was wheeled back to the operating theater room 7 The patient was placed in the usual supine position and intubated under general anesthesia without any difficulties The patient was given intraoperative antibiotics The patient was rolled onto the OSI table in usual prone position and prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion Initially a midline incision was made from the cephalad to caudad level Full thickness skin flaps were developed It was seen immediately that there was large amount of copious fluid emanating from the wound clear like fluid which was the cerebrospinal fluid Cultures were taken aerobic anaerobic AFB fungal Once this was done the paraspinal muscles were affected from the posterior elements It was seen that there were no facet complexes on the right side at L4 L5 and L5 S1 It was seen that the spine was listhesed at L5 and that the dural sac was pinched at the L4 5 level from the listhesis Once this was done however the fluid emanating from the dura could not be seen appropriately Complete laminectomy at L4 was performed as well extending the L5 laminectomy more to the left Complete laminectomy at L3 was done Once this was done within the subarticular recess on the right side at the L4 pedicle level a rent in the dura was seen Once this was appropriately cleaned the dural edges were approximated using a running 6 0 Prolene suture A Valsalva confirmed no significant lead after the repair was made There was a significant laterolisthesis at L4 L5 and due to the fact that there were no facet complexes at L5 S1 and L4 L5 on the right side as well as there was a significant concavity on the right L4 L5 disk space which was demonstrated from intraoperative x rays and compared to preoperative x rays it was decided from an instrumentation The lateral pedicle screws were placed at L4 L5 and S1 using the standard technique of Magerl After this the standard starting point was made Trajectory was completed with gearshift and sounded in all four quadrants to make sure there was no violation of the pedicle wall Once this was done this was undertapped at 1 mm and resounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there was no violation of the pedicle wall The screws were subsequently placed Tricortical purchase was obtained at S1 appropriate size screws Precontoured titanium rod was then appropriately planned and placed between the screws at L4 L5 and S1 This was done on the right side first The screw was torqued at S1 appropriately and subsequently at L5 Minimal compression was then placed between L5 and L4 to correct the concavity as well as laterolisthesis and the screw appropriately torqued at L4 Neutral compression distraction was obtained on the left side Screws were torqued at L4 L5 and S1 appropriately Good placement was seen both in AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy Laterolisthesis corrected appropriately at L4 and L5 Posterior spinal fusion was completed by decorticating the posterior elements at L4 L5 and the sacral ala with a curette Once good bleeding subchondral bone was appreciated the morselized bone from the laminectomy was morselized with corticocancellous bone chips together with demineralized bone matrix This was placed in the posterior lateral gutters DuraGen was then placed over the dural repair and after this fibrin glue was placed appropriately Deep retractors then removed from the confines of the wound Fascia was closed using interrupted Prolene running suture 1 Once this was done suprafascial drain was placed appropriately Subcutaneous tissues were opposed using a 2 0 Prolene suture The dermal edges were approximated using staples Wound was dressed sterilely using bacitracin ointment Xeroform 4 x 4 s and tape The drain was connected appropriately The patient was rolled on stretcher in usual supine

be within normal limits INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE The patient is a 44 year old female who had an endometrial ablation done in May which showed submucosal fibroids She had history of anemia and has been on iron therapy She started having bleeding three weeks ago with intermittent bouts of flooding She desired permanent and definitive therapy and therefore it was felt very appropriate to take the patient for a total abdominal hysterectomy The uterus cervix and right tube and ovary was sent to pathology for review PROCEDURE After informed consent was obtained all questions were answered to the patient s satisfaction in layman s term She was taken to the operating room where a general anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty She was examined under anesthesia with noted findings above She was placed in a dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion The Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first knife and was then carried down to the underlying layer of the fascia With the second knife the fascia was excised in the midline and extended laterally with the Mayo scissors The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with the Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected off sharply as well as bluntly Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the fascial incision which in a similar fashion was tented up and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected off sharply as well as bluntly The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline the peritoneum was identified entered bluntly and digitally Then the peritoneal incision was then extended superior and inferiorly with excellent visualization of the bladder The GYN Balfour was then placed A Lahey clamp was placed on the fundus of the uterus to pull the uterus into the operative field and the bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges Attention was then turned to the round ligaments bilaterally which were tented up with Allis clamps and then a hemostat was poked through the avascular portion underneath the round ligament and the O tie was passed through and then tied down Then the round ligament was transected and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic The round ligaments were then skeletonized to create a window in the broad ligament The right infundibulopelvic ligament was isolated through the window created from the round ligaments and then the infundibular ligament on the right was loop tied and then doubly clamped with straight Ochsner clamps and then transected and suture ligated with a 0 Vicryl in a Heaney stitch fashion It was noted to be hemostatic Attention was then turned to the left side in which the uterovarian vessel was isolated and then tied with an O tie and then doubly clamped with straight Ochsner clamps transected and suture ligated with a 0 Vicryl in a Heaney stitch fashion and noted to be hemostatic The vesicouterine peritoneum was then identified tented up with Allis clamps and then the bladder flap was created sharply with a Russian and Metzenbaum scissors Then the bladder was deflected off of the underlying cervix with blunt dissection with a moist Ray Tec sponge down to the level of the cervix The uterine vessels were skeletonized bilaterally and then clamped with straight Ochsner clamps and transected and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic In the similar fashion the broad ligament down to the level of the caudal ligament the uterosacral ligaments was clamped with curved Ochsner clamps and transected and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic The second Lahey clamp was then placed on the cervix The cervix was tented up and the pubocervical vesical fascia was transected with a long knife and then the vagina was entered with a double pointed scissors poked through well protecting posteriorly with a large malleable The cuff was then outlined The vaginal cuff was grasped with a Ochsner clamp and then the cervix uterus and the right tube and ovary were transected using the Jorgenson scissors The cuff outlined with Ochsner clamps The cuff was then painted with a Betadine soaked Ray Tec sponge and the sponge was placed over the vagina The vaginal cuff was then closed with a 0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion holding on to the beginning end on the right side as well as incorporating the ipsilateral cardinal ligaments into the cuff angles A long Allis was then used to grasp the mid portion of the cuff and a 0 Vicryl figure of eight stitch was placed in the mid portion of the cuff and tied down At this time the abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline and noted to be hemostatic The suture that was used to close the cuff was then used to come back through the posterior peritoneum grabbing the uterosacral ligaments and the mid portion of the cuff and then tied down to bring the cuff close and together Then the right round ligament was pulled into the cuff and tied down with the 0 Vicryl that was used as a figure of eight stitch in the middle of the cuff The left round ligament was too small to reach the cuff The abdomen was then again copiously irrigated with warm normal saline and noted to be hemostatic The peritoneum was then re peritonealized with a 3 0 Vicryl in a running fashion The GYN Balfour and all packing sponges were removed from the abdomen Then the abdomen was then once again copiously irrigated and the cuff and incision sites were once again reinspected and noted to be hemostatic The was placed back into the hollow of the sacrum The omentum was then pulled over to top of the bowel and then the peritoneum was then closed with a 3 0 Vicryl in a running fashion and then the fascia was closed with 0 Vicryl in a running fashion The skin was closed with staples

"Health1102","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 68 year old woman whom I have been following who has had angina In any case today she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent three days ago and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when I spoke to her I advised her to call 911 which she did While waiting for 911 she was attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain By the time she presented here she is currently pain free and is feeling well PAST CARDIAC HISTORY The patient has been having arm pain for several months She underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me which was equivocal but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia I had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy so we put her on a beta blocker However her arm pain symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain so she presented to the emergency room On 08 16 08 she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80 mid LAD lesion circumflex normal and RCA totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the left to the right as well as right to right to that area The decision was made to transfer her as she may be having collateral insufficiency from the LAD stenosis to the RCA vessel She underwent that with drug eluting stents on 08 16 08 with I believe three or four total placed and was discharged on 08 17 08 She had some left arm discomfort on 08 18 08 but this was mild Yesterday she felt very fatigued but no arm pain and today she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual nitroglycerin This is her usual angina She is being admitted with unstable angina post stent PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Longstanding hypertension CAD as above hyperlipidemia and overactive bladder MEDICATIONS 1 Detrol LA 2 mg once a day 2 Prilosec for GERD 20 mg once a day 3 Glucosamine 500 400 mg once a day for arthritis 4 Multivitamin p o daily 5 Nitroglycerin sublingual as available to her 6 Toprol XL 25 mg once a day which I started although she had been bradycardic but she seems to be tolerating 7 Aspirin 325 mg once a day 8 Plavix 75 mg once a day 9 Diovan 160 mg once a day 10 Claritin 10 mg once a day for allergic rhinitis 11 Norvasc 5 mg once a day 12 Lipitor 5 mg once a day 13 Evista 60 mg once a day ALLERGIES ALLERGIES TO MEDICATIONS ARE NONE SHE DENIES ANY SHRIMP OR SEA FOOD ALLERGY FAMILY HISTORY Her father died of an MI in his 50s and a brother had his first MI and bypass surgery at 54 SOCIAL HISTORY She does not smoke cigarettes abuse alcohol no use of illicit drugs She is divorced and lives alone and is a retired laboratory technician from Cornell Diagnostic Laboratory REVIEW OF SYSTEMS She denies a history of stroke cancer vomiting up blood coughing up blood bright red blood per rectum bleeding stomach ulcers renal calculi cholelithiasis asthma emphysema pneumonia tuberculosis home oxygen use or sleep apnea although she has been told in the past that she snores and there was some question of apnea in 05 08 No morning headaches or fatigue No psychiatric diagnosis No psoriasis no lupus Remainder of the review of systems is negative x14

AST 65 and these were normal on 08 15 08 INR is 0 89 PTT 20 9 white blood cell count 8 2 hematocrit 31 and it was 35 on 08 15 08 and platelet count 257 000 IMPRESSION AND PLAN The patient is a 68 year old woman with exertional angina characterized with arm pain who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and has now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery In any case given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she was even pain free I am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy We will continue her beta blocker and I cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already Aspirin Plavix valsartan Lipitor and Norvasc I am going to add Imdur and watch headaches as she apparently had some on nitro paste before and we will rule out MI although there is a little suspicion I suppose it is possible that she has non cardiac arm pain but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker so we can maximize beta blocker use for anti anginal effect My concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention which was severely stenotic and she does have normal LV function She will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis Claritin for allergies and Detrol LA for urinary incontinence Total patient care time in the emergency department 75 minutes All this was discussed in detail with the patient and her daughter who expressed understanding and agreement The patient desires full resuscitation status"

tendon ANESTHESIA General with an interscalene block COMPLICATIONS None Needle and sponge counts were done and correct INDICATION FOR OPERATION The patient is a 26 year old right hand dominant male who works in sales who was performing heavy bench press exercises when he felt a tearing burning pain severe in his right shoulder The patient presented with mild bruising over the proximal arm of the right side with x ray showing no fracture Over concerns for pectoralis tendon tear he was sent for MRI evaluation where a complete rupture of a portion of the pectoralis major tendon was noted Due to the patient s young age and active lifestyle surgical treatment was recommended in order to obtain best result The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed in detail with the patient including but not limited to scarring infection damage to blood vessels and nerves re rupture need further surgery loss of range of motion inability to return to heavy activity such as weight lifting complex usual pain syndrome and deep vein thrombosis as well as anesthetic risks Understanding all risks and benefits the patient desires to proceed with surgery as planned FINDINGS 1 Following deltopectoral approach to the right shoulder the pectoralis major tendon was encountered The clavicular head was noted to be intact There was noted to be complete rupture of the sternal head of the pectoralis major tendon with an oblique type tear having some remaining cuff on the humerus and some tendon attached to the retracted portion 2 Following freeing of adhesions using tracks and sutures the pectoralis major tendon was able to reapproximated to its insertion site on the humerus just lateral to the biceps 3 A soft tissue repair was performed with 5 FiberWire suture and a single suture anchor of 5 x 5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed in order to decrease tension at the repair site Following repair of soft tissue and using the bone anchor there was noted to be good apposition of the tendon with edges and a solid repair OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL The patient was identified in the preop holding area His right shoulder was identified marked his appropriate surgical site after verification with the patient He was then taken to the operating room where he was transferred to the operative table in supine position and placed under general anesthesia by anesthesiology team He then received prophylactic antibiotics A time out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient extremity surgery performed administration of antibiotics and the availability of equipment At this point the patient was placed to a modified beech chair position with care taken to ensure all appropriate pressure points were padded and there was no pressure over the eyes The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion Preoperative markings were still visible at this point A deltopectoral incision was made utilizing the inferior portion Dissection was carried down The deltoid was retracted laterally The clavicular head of the pectoralis major was noted to be intact with the absence of the sternal insertion There was a small cuff of tissue left on the proximal humerus associated with the clavicular head Gentle probing medially revealed the end of the sternal retracted portion traction sutures of 5 Ethibond were used in this to allow for retraction and freeing from light adhesion This allowed reapproximation of the retracted tendon to the tendon stump At this point a repair using 5 FiberWire was then performed of the pectoralis major tendon back to stump on the proximal humerus noting good apposition of the tendon edges and no gapping of the repair site At this point a single metal suture anchor was attempted to be implanted just lateral to the insertion of the pectoralis in order to remove tension off the repair site however the inserted device attached to the metal anchor broke during insertion due to significant hardness of the bone For this reason the starting hole was tapped and a 5x5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed doubly loaded The sutures were then weaved through the lateral aspect of the torn tendon and a modified Krackow type performed and sutured thereby relieving tension off the soft tissue repair At this point there was noted to be excellent apposition of the soft tissue ends and a solid repair to gentle manipulation Aggressive external rotation was not performed The wound was then copiously irrigated The cephalic vein was not injured during the case The skin was then closed using a 2 0 Vicryl followed by a 3 0 subcuticular Prolene suture with Steri Strips Sterile dressing was then placed Anesthesia was then performed interscalene block The patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transported to postanesthesia care in stable condition in a shoulder immobilizer with the arm adducted and internally rotated Plan for this patient the patient will remain in the shoulder immobilizer until followup visit in approximately 10 days We will then start a gentle Codman type exercises and having limited motion until the 4 6 week point based on the patient s progression"

thus before and after the procedure 3 Mediastinal lymph node sampling including levels 4R and 7 4 Tube thoracostomy x2 including a 19 French Blake and a 32 French chest tube 5 Multiple chest wall biopsies and excision of margin on anterior chest wall adjacent to adherent tumor ANESTHESIA General endotracheal anesthesia with double lumen endotracheal tube DISPOSITION OF SPECIMENS To pathology both for frozen and permanent analysis FINDINGS The right middle lobe tumor was adherent to the anterior chest wall The adhesion was taken down and the entire pleural surface along the edge of the adhesion was sent for pathologic analysis The final frozen pathology on this entire area returned as negative for tumor Additional chest wall abnormalities were biopsied and sent for pathologic analysis and these all returned separately as negative for tumor and only fibrotic tissue Several other biopsies were taken and sent for permanent analysis of the chest wall All of the biopsy sites were additionally marked with Hemoclips The right middle lobe lesion was accompanied with distal pneumonitis and otherwise no direct involvement of the right upper lobe or right lower lobe ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Less than 100 mL CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AFTER SURGERY Stable HISTORY OF PROCEDURE This patient is well known to our service He was admitted the night before surgery and given hemodialysis and had close blood sugar monitoring in control The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room on April 4 2007 was given general anesthesia and was endotracheally intubated without incident Although he had markedly difficult airway the patient had fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed all the way down to the level of the subsegmental bronchi No abnormalities were noted in the entire tracheobronchial tree and based on this the decision was made to proceed with the surgery The patient was kept in the supine position and the single lumen endotracheal tube was removed and a double lumen tube was placed Following this the patient was placed into the left lateral decubitus position with the right side up and all pressure points were padded Sterile DuraPrep preparation on the right chest was placed A sterile drape around that was also placed The table was flexed to open up the intercostal spaces A second bronchoscopy was performed to confirm placement of the double lumen endotracheal tube Marcaine was infused into all incision areas prior to making an incision The incisions for the VATS right middle lobectomy included a small 1 cm incision for the auscultatory incision approximately 4 cm inferior to the inferior tip of the scapula The camera port was in the posterior axillary line in the eighth intercostal space through which a 5 mm 30 degree scope was used Third incision was an anterior port which was approximately 2 cm inferior to the inframammary crease and the midclavicular line in the anterior sixth intercostal space and the third incision was a utility port which was a 4 cm long incision which was approximately one rib space below the superior pulmonary vein All of these incisions were eventually created during the procedure The initial incision was the camera port through which under direct visualization an additional small 5 mm port was created just inferior to the anterior port These two ports were used to identify the chest wall lesions which were initially thought to be metastatic lesions Multiple biopsies of the chest wall lesions were taken and the decision was made to also insert the auscultatory incision port Through these three incisions the initial working of the diagnostic portion of the chest wall lesion was performed Multiple biopsies were taken of the entire chest wall offers and specimens came back as negative The right middle lobe was noted to be adherent to the anterior chest wall This area was taken down and the entire pleural surface along this area was taken down and sent for frozen pathologic analysis This also returned as negative with only fibrotic tissue and a few lymphocytes within the fibrotic tissue but no tumor cells Based on this the decision was made to not proceed with chest wall resection and continue with right middle lobectomy Following this the anterior port was increased in size and the utility port was made and meticulous dissection from an anterior to posterior direction was performed The middle lobe branch of the right superior pulmonary vein was initially dissected and stapled with vascular load 45 mm EndoGIA stapler Following division of the right superior pulmonary vein the right middle lobe bronchus was easily identified Initially this was thought to be the main right middle lobe bronchus but in fact it was the medial branch of the right middle lobe bronchus This was encircled and divided with a blue load stapler with a 45 mm EndoGIA Following division of this the pulmonary artery was easily identified Two branches of the pulmonary artery were noted to be going into the right middle lobe These were individually divided with a vascular load after encircling with a right angle clamp The vascular staple load completely divided these arterial branches successfully from the main pulmonary artery trunk and following this an additional branch of the bronchus was noted to be going to the right middle lobe A fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed intraoperatively and confirmed that this was in fact the lateral branch of the right middle lobe bronchus This was divided with a blue load stapler 45 mm EndoGIA Following division of this the minor and major fissures were completed along the edges of the right middle lobe separating the right upper lobe from the right middle lobe as well as the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe Following complete division of the fissure the lobe was put into an EndoGIA bag and taken out through the utility port Following removal of the right middle lobe a meticulous lymph node dissection sampling was performed excising the lymph node package in the 4R area as well as the 7 lymph node package Node station 8 or 9 nodes were easily identified therefore none were taken The patient was allowed to ventilate under water on the right lung with no obvious air leaking noted A 19 French Blake was placed into the posterior apical position and a 32 French chest tube was placed in the anteroapical position Following this the patient s lung was allowed to reexpand fully and the patient was checked for air leaking once again Following this all the ports were closed with 2 0 Vicryl suture used for the deeper tissue and 3 0 Vicryl suture was used to reapproximate the subcutaneous tissue and 4 0 Monocryl suture was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion The patient tolerated the procedure well was extubated in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in stable condition"

PROCEDURES PERFORMED 1 Left midface elevation with nasolabial fold elevation 2 Left nasolabial fold z plasty and right symmetrization midface elevation ANESTHESIA General endotracheal intubation ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Less than 25 mL FLUIDS Crystalloid CULTURES TAKEN None PATIENT S CONDITION Stable IMPLANTS Coapt Endotine Midface B 4 5 bioabsorbable implants reference CFD0200197 lot 01447 used on the right and used on the left side IDENTIFICATION This patient is well known to the Stanford Plastic Surgery Service The patient is status post resection of the dorsal nasal sidewall skin cancer with nasolabial flap reconstruction with subsequent deformity In particular the patient has had effacement of his alar crease with deepening of his nasolabial fold and notable asymmetry The patient was seen in consultation and felt to be a surgical candidate for improvement Risks and benefits of the operation were described to the patient in detail including but not limited to bleeding infection scarring possible damage to surrounding structures including neurovascular structures need for revision of surgery continued asymmetry and anesthetic complication The patient understood these risks and benefits and consented to the operation PROCEDURE IN DETAIL The patient was taken to OR and placed supine on the operating table Dose of antibiotics was given to the patient Compression devices were placed on the lower extremities to prevent the knee embolic events The patient was turned to 180 degrees The ETT tube was secured and the area was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion A head wrap was then placed on the position and we then began our local Of note the patient had previous incisions just lateral to his lateral canthus bilaterally and that were used for access Local consisting a 50 50 mix of 0 25 Marcaine with epinephrine and 1 lidocaine with epinephrine was then injected into the subperiosteal plane taking care to prevent injury to the infraorbital nerves This was done bilaterally We then marked the nasolabial fold and began with the elevation of the left midface We began with a lateral canthal type incision extending out over his previous incision down to subcutaneous tissue We continued down to the lateral orbital rim until we identified periosteum We then pulled in a periosteal elevator and elevated the midface down over the zygoma elevating some lateral mesenteric attachments down over the buccal region until we felt we had reached pass the nasolabial folds medially Care was taken to preserve the infraorbital nerve and that was visualized after elevation We then released the periosteum distally and retracted up on the periosteum and noted improved contour of the nasolabial fold with increased bulk over the midface region over the zygoma We then used our Endotine Coapt device to engage the periosteum at the desired location and then elevated the midface and secured into position using the Coapt bioabsorbable screw After this was then carried out we then clipped and cut as well as the end of the screw Satisfied with this we then elevated the periosteum and secured it to reinforce our midface elevation to the lateral orbital rim and this was done using 3 0 Monocryl Several sutures were then used to anchor the orbicularis and deeper tissue to create additional symmetry Excess skin along the incision was then removed as well the skin from just lateral to the canthus Care was taken to leave the orbicularis muscle down We then continued closing our incision using absorbable plain gut 5 0 sutures for the subciliary type incision and then continuing with interrupted 6 0 Prolenes lateral to the canthus We then turned our attention to performing the z plasty portion of the case A z plasty was designed along the previous scar where it was padding to the notable scar deformity and effacement of crease and the z plasty was then designed to lengthen along the scar to improve the contour This was carried out using a 15 blade down to subcutaneous tissue The flaps were debulked slightly to reduce the amount of fullness and then transposed and sutured into place using chromic suture At this point we then noted that he had improvement of the nasal fold but continued asymmetry with regards to improved bulk on the left side and less bulk on the right and it was felt that a symmetrization procedure was required to make more symmetry with the midface bilaterally and nasolabial folds bilaterally As such we then carried out the dissection after injecting local as noted and we used a 15 blade scalpel to create our incision along the lateral canthus along its preexisting incision We carried this down to the lateral orbital rim again elevating the periosteum taking care to preserve infraorbital nerve At this point we then released the periosteum distally just at the level of the nasolabial fold and placed our Endotine midface implant into the desired area and then elevated slightly just for symmetry only This was then secured in place using the bioabsorbable screw and then resected a very marginal amount of tissue just for removal of the dog ear deformity and closed the deeper layers of tissue using 3 0 PDS and then closing the extension to the subciliary area using 5 0 plain gut and then 6 0 Prolene lateral to the canthus At this point we felt that we had achieved improved contour improved symmetry and decreased effacement of the nasolabial fold and alar crease Satisfied with our procedures we then placed cool compresses on to the eyes The patient was then extubated and brought to the PACU in stable condition Dr X was present and scrubbed for the entire case and actively participated during all key elements Dr Y was available and participated in the portions of the case as well"

"Health1204","HISTORY The patient is a 10 1 2 year old born with asplenia syndrome with a complex cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava complete atrioventricular septal defect a total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right sided atrium and double outlet to the right ventricle with malposed great vessels the aorta being anterior with a severe pulmonary stenosis He had undergone staged repair beginning on 04 21 1997 with a right modified Blalock Taussig shunt followed on 09 02 1999 with a bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt and left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery pericardial patch augmentation These procedures were performed at Medical College Hospital Family states that they moved to the United States Evaluation at the Children s Hospital earlier this year demonstrated complete occlusion of the right bidirectional Glenn shunt as well as occlusion of the proximal right pulmonary artery He was also found to have elevated Glenn pressures at 22 mmHg transpulmonary gradient axis of 14 mmHg The QP QS ratio of 0 6 1 A large decompressing venous collateral was also appreciated The patient was brought back to cardiac catheterization in an attempt to reconstitute the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and to occlude the venous collateral vessel DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia the patient was prepped and draped Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique and the patient was heparinized Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG continuous pulse oximetry and cycled cuff blood pressures in addition to intravascular pressures Using a 6 French sheath a 6 French wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava into the right sided atrium pulmonary veins and the right ventricle Using a 6 French sheath a 5 French pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta and ascending aorta A separate port of arterial access was obtained in the left femoral artery utilizing a 5 French sheath Percutaneous access into the right jugular vein was attempted but unsuccessful Ultrasound on the right neck demonstrated a complete thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein Using percutaneous technique and a 5 French sheath 5 French wedge catheter was inserted into the left internal jugular vein and advanced along the left superior vena cava across the left caval pulmonary anastomosis into the main pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery with aid of guidewire This catheter then also advanced into the bridging innominate vein The catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 4 French Bernstein catheter which was advanced to the blind end of the right superior vena cava A balloon wedge angiogram of the right lower pulmonary vein demonstrated back filling of a small right lower pulmonary artery There was no vascular continuity to the stump of the right Glenn The jugular venous catheter and sheaths were exchanged over a wire for a 6 French flexor sheath which was advanced to the proximal right superior vena cava The Bernstein catheter was then reintroduced using a Terumo guidewire Probing of the superior vena cava facilitated access into the right lower pulmonary artery The angiogram in the right pulmonary artery showed a diminutive right lower pulmonary artery and severe long segment proximal stenosis The distal pulmonary measured approximately 5 5 to 60 mm in diameter with a long segment stenosis measuring approximately 31 mm in length The length of the obstruction was balloon dilated using ultra thin SD 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of the waist This facilitated advancement of a flexor sheath into the proximal portion of the stenosis A PG 2960 BPX Genesis stent premounted on a 6 mm OptiProbe A balloon catheter was advanced across the area of narrowing and inflated with a near complete disappearance of proximal waist Angiogram demonstrated a good stent apposition to the caval wall Further angioplasty was then performed utilizing an ultra thin SDS 8 x 3 cm balloon catheter inflated to 19 atmospheres pressure with complete disappearance of a distinct proximal waist Angiogram demonstrated wide patency of reconstituted right caval pulmonary anastomosis though there was no flow seen to the right upper pulmonary artery The balloon wedge angiograms were then obtained in the right upper pulmonary veins suggesting the presence of right upper pulmonary artery and not contiguous with the right lower pulmonary artery Bernstein catheter was advanced into the main pulmonary artery where a wire probing of the stump of the proximal right pulmonary artery facilitated access to the right upper pulmonary artery Angiogram demonstrated severe long segment stenosis of the proximal right pulmonary artery Angioplasty of the right pulmonary was then performed using the OptiProbe 6 mm balloon catheter inflated to 16 atmospheres pressure with disappearance of a distinct waist Repeat angiogram showed improvement in caliber of right upper pulmonary artery with filling defect of the proximal right pulmonary artery The proximal right pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted using a PG 2980 BPX Genesis stent premounted on 8 mm OptiProbe balloon catheter and implanted with complete disappearance of the waist Distal right upper pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted utilizing a PG 1870 BPX Genesis stent premounted on 7 mm OptiProbe balloon catheter Repeat angiograms were then performed Attention was then directed to the large venous collateral vessel arising from the left superior vena cava with a contrast filling of a left sided azygos vein A selective angiogram demonstrated a large azygos vein of the midsection measuring approximately 9 4 mm in diameter An Amplatzer 12 mm vascular plug was loaded on the delivery catheter and advanced through the flexor sheath into the azygos vein Once stable device was confirmed the device was released from the delivery catheter The 4 French Bernstein catheter was then reintroduced and 5 inch empirical 0 038 inch 10 cm x 8 mm detachable coils were then implanted above the vascular plug filling the proximal azygos vein A pigtail catheter was then introduced into the left superior vena cava for final angiogram Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity Cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the coronary sinus of pulmonary veins the innominate vein superior vena cava the main pulmonary artery and azygos vein After angiography two normal appearing renal collecting systems were visualized The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition There were no complications DISCUSSION Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal mixed venous saturation but was low due to systemic arterial desaturation of 79 The pulmonary veins were fully saturated with partial pressure of oxygen ranging between 120 and 169 mmHg in 30 oxygen Remaining saturations reflected complete admixture There was increased saturation in the left pulmonary artery due to aortopulmonary collateral flow Phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an A wave somewhat to the normal right ventricular end diastolic pressure of 9 mmHg Left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta Phasic ascending descending pressures were similar and normal Mean Glenn pressures at initiation of the case were slightly elevated at 14 mmHg with a transpulmonary gradient of 9 mmHg The calculated systemic flow was a normal pulmonary flows reduced with a QP QS ratio of 0 6 1 The pulmonary vascular resistance was elevated at 4 4 Woods units Following stent implantation in the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and right pulmonary artery there was a slight increase in the Glenn venous pressures to 16 mmHg Following embolization of the azygos vein there was increase in systemic arterial saturation to 84 and increase in mixed venous saturation There was similar increase in Glenn pressures to 28 mmHg with a transpulmonary gradient of 14 mmHg There was an increase in arterial pressure The calculated systemic flow increased from 3 1 liters minute meter squared to 4 3 liters minute meter squared Angiogram within the innominate vein following stent implantation demonstrated appropriate stent position without significant distortion of the innominate vein or proximal cava There appeared unobstructed contrast flow to the right lower pulmonary artery of a 1 mmHg mean pressure gradient There was absence of contrast filling of the right middle and right upper pulmonary artery Final angiogram with a contrast injection in the left superior vena cava showed a forward flow through the right Glenn a good contrast filling of the right lower pulmonary artery and a widely patent left Glenn negative contrast washout of the proximal right pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow Contrast injection within the right upper pulmonary artery following the stent implantation demonstrated widely patent proximal right pulmonary artery along the length of the implanted stents though with retrograde contrast flow INITIAL DIAGNOSES 1 Asplenia syndrome 2 Dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava 3 Atrioventricular septal defect 4 Total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right sided atrium 5 Double outlet right ventricle with malposed great vessels 6 Severe pulmonary stenosis 7 Separate hepatic venous drainage into the atria PRIOR

250 cc INDICATIONS FOR THE OPERATION This is the case of a very pleasant 41 year old Caucasian male well known to me from previous anterior cervical discectomy and posterior decompression Last surgery consisted of four level decompression on 08 28 06 The patient continued to complain of posterior neck pain radiating to both trapezius Review of his MRI revealed the presence of what still appeared to be residual lateral recess stenosis It also raised the possibility of instability and based on this I recommended decompression and posterolateral spinal instrumention however intraoperatively it appeared like there was no abnormal movement of any of the joint segments however there was still residual stenosis since the laminectomy that was done previously was partial Based on this I did total decompression by removing the lamina of C3 through C6 and doing bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy at C3 C4 C4 C5 C5 C6 and C6 C7 with no spinal instrumentation Operation and expected outcome risks and benefits were discussed with him prior to the surgery Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection Infection can be superficial but may also extend down to the epidural space which may require return to the operating room and evacuation of the infection There is also the risk of bleeding that could be superficial but may also be in the epidural space resulting in compression of spinal cord This may result in weakness of all four extremities numbness of all four extremities and impairment of bowel and bladder function which will require an urgent return to the operating room and evacuation of the hematoma There is also the risk of a dural tear with its attendant problems of CSF leak headache nausea vomiting photophobia pseudomeningocele and dural meningitis This too may require return to the operating room for evacuation of said pseudomeningocele and repair The patient understood the risk of the surgery I told him there is just a 30 chance that there will be no improvement with the surgery he understands this and agreed to have the procedure performed DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE The patient was brought to the operating room awake alert not in any form of distress After smooth induction and intubation a Foley catheter was inserted Monitoring leads were also placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics for both SSEP and EMG monitoring The SSEPs were normal and the EMGs were silent during the entire case After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads the patient was then positioned prone on a Wilson frame with the head supported on a foam facial support Shave was then carried out over the occipital and suboccipital region All pressure points were padded I proceeded to mark the hypertrophic scar for excision This was initially cleaned with alcohol and prepped with DuraPrep After sterile drapes were laid out incision was made using a scalpel blade 10 Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to excise the hypertrophic scar Dissection was then carried down to the cervical fascia and by careful dissection to the scar tissue the spinous process of C2 was then identified There was absence of the spinous process of C3 C4 C5 and C6 but partial laminectomy was noted removal of only 15 of the lamina With this completed we proceeded to do a total laminectomy at C3 C4 C5 and C6 which was technically difficult due to the previous surgery There was also a dural tear on the right C3 C4 space that was exposed and repaired with Prolene 6 0 and later with Tisseel By careful dissection and the use of a 5 and 3 mm bur total laminectomy was done as stated with bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy done at C3 C4 C4 C5 C5 C6 and C6 C7 There was significant epidural bleeding which was carefully coagulated At two points I had to pack this with small pieces of Gelfoam After repair of the dural tear Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage

during the epidural She did not notice any difference in her lower extremities at the time she had the epidural however she reports that she was extremely sleepy and may not have been aware of any change in strength or sensation in her lower extremities at that time She delivered on the 31st of October by Cesarean section because she had failed to progress and had pyrexia She also had a Foley catheter placed at that time On the 1st of November 2008 they began to mobilize her and it was at that time that she first noticed that she could not walk She was aware that she could not move her legs at all and then within a few days she was aware that she could move toes in the left foot but could not move her right foot at all Since that time there has been a gradual improvement in strength to the point that she now has limited movement in her left leg and severely restricted movement in her right leg She is not able to walk by herself and needs assistance to stand She was discharged

neurological disease She has one child a son born on October 31 2008 SOCIAL HISTORY The patient is a civil engineer who currently works from home She is working approximately half time because of limitations imposed on her by her disability need to attend frequent physical therapy and also the needs of looking after her baby She does not smoke and does not drink and has never done either GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION VITAL SIGNS P 74 BP 144 75 and a pain score of 0 GENERAL Her general physical examination was unremarkable CARDIOVASCULAR Normal first and second heart sound regular pulse with normal volume RESPIRATORY Unremarkable both lung bases were clear and respiration was normal GI Unremarkable with no organomegaly and normal bowel sounds NEUROLOGICAL EXAM MSE The patient s orientation was normal fund of knowledge was normal memory was normal speech was normal calculation was normal and immediate and long term recall was normal Executive function was normal CRANIAL NERVES The cranial nerve examination II through XII was unremarkable Both disks were normal with normal retina Pupils were equal and reactive to light Eye movements were full Facial sensation and strength was normal Bulbar function was normal The trapezius had normal strength MOTOR Muscle tone showed a slight increase in tone in the lower extremities with normal tone in the upper extremities Muscle strength was 5 5 in all muscle groups in the upper extremities In the lower extremities the hip flexors were 1 5 bilaterally hip extensors were 1 5 bilaterally knee extension on the right was 1 5 and on the left was 3 5 knee flexion was 2 5 on the right and 3 5 on the left foot dorsiflexion was 0 5 on the right and 1 5 on the left foot plantar flexion was 4 5 on the right and 4 5 on the left toe extension was 0 5 on the right and 4 5 on the left toe flexion was 4 5 on the right and 4 5 on the left REFLEXES Reflexes in the upper extremities were 2 bilaterally In the lower extremities they were 0 bilaterally at the knee and ankles The abdominal reflexes were present above the umbilicus and absent below the umbilicus The plantar responses were mute The jaw reflex was normal SENSATION Vibration was moderately decreased in the right great toe and was mildly decreased in the left great toe There was a sensory level to light touch at approximately T7 posteriorly and approximately T9 anteriorly There was a range of sensation but clearly there was a decrease in sensation below this level but not complete loss of sensation To pain the sensory level is even less clear but appeared to be at about T7 on the right side In the lower extremities there was a slight decrease in pin and light touch in the right great toe compared to the left There was no evidence of allodynia or hyperesthesia Joint position sense was mildly reduced in the right toe and normal on the left COORDINATION Coordination for rapid alternating movements and finger to nose testing was normal Coordination could not be tested in the lower extremities GAIT The patient was unable to stand and therefore we were unable to test gait or Romberg s There was no evidence of focal back tenderness REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RECORDS I have reviewed the records from ABC Hospital including the letter from Dr Y and the EMG report dated 12 17 2008 from Dr X The EMG report shows evidence of a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy below approximately T6 The lower extremity sensory responses are essentially normal however there is a decrease in the amplitude of the motor responses with minimal changes in latency I do have the MRI of lumbar spine report from 11 06 2008 with and without contrast This showed a minimal concentric disc bulge of L4 L5 without disc herniation but was otherwise unremarkable The patient brought a disc with a most recent MRI study however we were unable to open this on our computers The verbal report is that the study was unremarkable except for some gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots A Doppler of the lower extremities showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity Chest x ray showed some scoliosis on the lumbar spine curve to the left but no evidence of other abnormalities A CT pelvis study performed on November 07 2008 showed some nonspecific fluid in the subcutaneous fat of the back posterior to L4 and L5 levels however there were no pelvic masses or other abnormalities We were able to obtain an update of the report from the MRI of the lumbar spine with and without contrast dated 12 30 2008 The complete study included the cervical thoracic and lumbar spine There was diffuse enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina that had increased in enhancement since prior exam in November It was also reported that the patient was given intravenous methylprednisolone and this had had no effect on strength in her lower extremities IMPRESSION The patient has a condition that is temporarily related to the epidural injection she was given at the end of October 2008 prior to her Cesarean section It appears she became aware of weakness within two days of the administration of the epidural she was very tired during the epidural and may have missed some change in her neurological function She was severely weak in both lower extremities slightly worse on the right than the left There has been some interval improvement in her strength since the beginning of November 2008 Her EMG study from the end of December is most consistent with a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy The MRI findings of gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots would be most consistent with an inflammatory radiculitis most likely related to the epidural anesthesia or administration of the epidural There had been no response to IV methylprednisolone given to her at ABC The issue of having a lumbar puncture to look for evidence of inflammatory cells or an elevated protein had been discussed with her at both ABC and by myself The patient did not wish to consider a lumbar puncture because of concerns that this might worsen her condition At the present time she is able to stand with aid but is unable to walk There is no evidence on her previous EMG of a demyelinating neuropathy RECOMMENDATIONS 1 The diagnostic issues were discussed with the patient at length She is informed that this is still early in the course of the problem and that we expect her to show some improvement in her function over the next one to two years although it is unclear as to how much function she will regain 2 She is strongly recommended to continue with vigorous physical therapy and to continue with the plan to mobilize her as much as possible with the goal of trying to get her ambulatory If she is able to walk she will need bilateral AFOs for her ankles to improve her overall mobility I am not prescribing these because at the present time she does not need them 3 We discussed increasing the dose of gabapentin The paresthesias that she has may indicate that she is actually regaining some sensory function although there is a concern that as recovery continues she may be left with significant neuropathic pain If this is the case I have advised her to increase her gabapentin dose from 300 mg b i d gradually up to 300 mg four times a day and then to 600 mg to 900 mg four times a day She may need other neuropathic pain medications as needed She will determine whether her current symptoms are significant enough to require this increase in dosage 4 The patient will follow up with Dr Y and his team at ABC Hospital She will also continue with physical therapy within the ABC system"

SPECIMENS Included right renal mass as well as biopsies from the base of the resection ANESTHESIA General endotracheal COMPLICATIONS None DRAINS Included a JP drain in the right flank as well as a 16 French Foley catheter per urethra BRIEF HISTORY The patient is a 60 year old gentleman with a history of an enhancing right renal mass approximately 2 cm in diameter I had a long discussion with him concerning variety of options We talked in particular about extirpated versus ablative surgery Based on his young age and excellent state of health decision was made at this point to proceed to a right partial nephrectomy laparoscopically All questions were answered and he wished to proceed with surgery as planned Note that the patient does have a positive family history of renal cell carcinoma PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After acquisition of proper informed consent and administration of perioperative antibiotics the patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table After institution of adequate general anesthetic via endotracheal rod he was placed into the right anterior flank position with his right side elevated on a roll and his right arm across his chest All pressure points were carefully padded and he was securely taped to the table Note that sequential compression devices were in place on both lower extremities and were activated prior to induction of anesthesia His abdomen was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion Note that a 16 French Foley catheter was in place per urethra as well as an orogastric tube The abdomen was insufflated at the right lateral abdomen using the Veress needle to a pressure of 15 without incident We then placed a Visiport 10 x 12 trocar in the right lateral abdomen With the trocar in place we were able to place the remaining trocars under direct laparoscopic visualization We placed three additional trocars An 11 mm screw type trocar at the umbilicus a 6 screw type trocar 7 cm in the midline above the umbilicus and a 10 x 12 trocar to serve as a retractor port approximately 8 cm inferior in the midline The procedure was begun by reflecting the right colon by incising the white line of Toldt The colon was reflected medially and the retroperitoneum was exposed on that side This was a fairly superficial lesion so decision was made in advance to potentially not perform vascular clamping however I did feel it important to get high level control prior to proceeding to the partial With the colon reflected the duodenum was identified and it was reflected medially under Kocher maneuver The ureter and gonadal vein were identified on the right side and elevated The space between the ureter and the gonadal vein was then developed and the gonadal vein was dropped elevating only the ureter and carrying this plane dissection up towards the renal hilum Once we got up to the renal hilum we were able to skeletonize the renal hilar vessels partially and in particular we did develop some of the upper pole dissection above the level of the hilum to provide for access for a Satinsky clamp or bulldogs The remainder of the kidney was then freed off its lateral and superior attachments primarily using the Harmonic scalpel and the LigaSure device With the kidney free and the hilum prepared the Gerota fascia was taken down overlying the kidney exposing the renal parenchyma and using this approach we were able to identify the 2 cm right renal mass located in the lower pole laterally A cap of fat was left overlying this mass Based on the position of the mass we performed intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasound which showed the mass to be somewhat deeper than initially anticipated Based on this finding I decided to go ahead and clamp the renal hilum during resection A Satinsky clamp was introduced through the lower most trocar site and used to clamp the renal hilum en bloc Note that the patient had been receiving renal protection protocol including fenoldopam and mannitol throughout the procedure and he also received Lasix prior to clamping the renal hilum With the renal hilum clamped we did resect the tumor using cold scissors There was somewhat more bleeding than would be expected based on the hilar clamping however we were able to successfully resect this lesion We also took a biopsy at the base of the resection and passed off the table as a specimen for frozen section With the tumor resected the base of the resection was then cauterized using the Argon beam coagulator and several bleeding vessels were oversewn using figure of eight 3 0 Vicryl sutures with lap ties for tensioning We then placed a FloSeal into the wound and covered it with a Surgicel and held the pressure We then released the vascular clamp Total clamp time was 11 minutes There was minimal bleeding and occlusion of this maneuver and after unclamping the kidney the kidney pinked up appropriately and appeared well perfused after removal of the clamp We then replaced the kidney within its Gerota envelope and closed that with 3 0 Vicryl using lap ties for tensioning A JP drain was introduced through the right flank and placed adjacent to the kidney and sutured the skin with 2 0 nylon The specimen was placed into a 10 mm Endocatch bag and extracted from the lower most trocar site after extending it approximately 1 cm It was evaluated on the table and passed off the table for Pathology to evaluate They stated that the tumor was close to the margin but there appeared to be 1 2 mm normal parenchyma around the tumor In addition the frozen section biopsies from the base of the resection were negative for renal cell carcinoma Based on these findings the lower most trocar site was closed using a running 0 Vicryl suture in the fascia We then re insufflated the abdomen and carefully evaluated the entire intraoperative field for hemostasis Any bleeding points were controlled primarily using bipolar cautery or hemoclips The area was copiously irrigated with normal saline The colon was then replaced into its normal anatomic position The mesentry was evaluated There were no defects noted We closed the 10 x 12 lateral most trocar site using a Carter Thompson closure device with 0 Vicryl All trocars were removed under direct visualization and the abdomen was desufflated prior to removal of the last trocar The skin incisions were irrigated with normal saline and infiltrated with 0 25 Marcaine and the skin was closed using a running 4 0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion Benzoin and Steri Strips were placed The patient was returned in supine position and awoken from general anesthetic without incident He was then transferred to hospital gurney and taken to the postanesthesia care unit for postoperative monitoring At the end of the case sponge instrument and needle counts were correct I was scrubbed and present throughout the entire case"

"Health1231","REASON FOR CONSULTATION I was asked by Dr X to see the patient in consultation for a new diagnosis of colon cancer HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient presented to medical attention after she noticed mild abdominal cramping in February 2007 At that time she was pregnant and was unsure if her symptoms might have been due to the pregnancy Unfortunately she had miscarriage at about seven weeks She again had abdominal cramping severe in late March 2007 She underwent colonoscopy on 04 30 2007 by Dr Y Of note she is with a family history of early colon cancers and had her first colonoscopy at age 35 and no polyps were seen at that time On colonoscopy she was found to have a near obstructing lesion at the splenic flexure She was not able to have the scope passed past this lesion Pathology showed a colon cancer although I do not have a copy of that report at this time She had surgical resection done yesterday The surgery was laparoscopic assisted with anastomosis At the time of surgery lymph nodes were palpable Pathology showed colon adenocarcinoma low grade measuring 3 8 x 1 7 cm circumferential and invading in to the subserosal mucosa greater than 5 mm 13 lymph nodes were negative for metastasis There was no angiolymphatic invasion noted Radial margin was 0 1 mm Other margins were 5 and 6 mm Testing for microsatellite instability is still pending Staging has already been done with a CT scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis This showed a mass at the splenic flexure mildly enlarged lymph nodes there and no evidence of metastasis to liver lungs or other organs The degenerative changes were noted at L5 S1 The ovaries were normal An intrauterine device IUD was present in the uterus REVIEW OF SYSTEMS She has otherwise been feeling well She has not had fevers night sweats or noticed lymphadenopathy She has not had cough shortness of breath back pain bone pain blood in her stool melena or change in stool caliber She was eating well up until the time

PLAN Newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer with a stage T3c N0 M0 colon cancer grade 1 She does not have high risk factors such as high grade or angiolymphatic invasion and adequate number of lymph nodes were sampled Although the tumor was near obstructing she was not having symptoms and in fact was having normal bowel movements A lengthy discussion was held with the patient regarding her diagnosis and prognosis Firstly she has a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy I would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age Referring to the database that had been online she has a 13 chance of relapse in the next five years and with aggressive chemotherapy X linked agammaglobulinemia XLA platinum based this would be reduced to an 8 risk of relapse with a 5 benefit Chemotherapy with 5 FU based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 2 5 Plan was made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discuss the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effects We did not review all that information today She has a family history of early colon cancer Her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the paternal family history if we can Tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability and we will discuss this when those results are available She has one sibling and he is up to date on colonoscopy She does report multiple tubes of blood were drawn prior to her admission I will check with Dr Y s office whether she has had a

patient also requests sterilization Therefore she requested a tubal ligation PROCEDURE After informed consent was obtained and all questions were answered to the patient s satisfaction in layman s terms she was taken to the operating room where a spinal with Astramorph anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty She was placed in the dorsal supine position with a leftward tilt and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made removing the old scar with a first knife and then carried down to the underlying layer of fascia with a second knife The fascia was excised in the midline extended laterally with the Mayo scissors The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle dissected off sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors There was noted dense adhesions at this point as well as a wire mesh was noted The anterior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle dissected off sharply as well as bluntly The rectus muscle superiorly was opened with a hemostat The peritoneum was identified and entered bluntly digitally The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly up to the level of the mesh Then inferiorly using the knife the adhesions were taken down and the bladder was identified and the peritoneum incision extended inferiorly to the level of the bladder The bladder blade was inserted and vesicouterine peritoneum was identified and tented up with Allis clamps and bladder flap was created sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors digitally The bladder blade was then reinserted to protect the bladder and the uterine incision was made with a first knife and then extended laterally with the Bandage scissors The amniotic fluid was noted to be clear At this point upon examining the intrauterine contents the baby was noted to be breached The right foot was identified and then the baby was delivered from the double footling breach position without any difficulty The cord was clamped and the baby was then handed off to awaiting pediatricians The placenta cord gases were obtained and the placenta was then manually extracted from the uterus The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris Then the uterine incision was then closed with 0 Vicryl in a double closure stitch fashion first layer in locking stitch fashion and the second layer an imbricating layer Attention at this time was turned to the tubes bilaterally Both tubes were isolated and followed all the way to the fimbriated end and tented up with the Babcock clamp The hemostat was probed through the mesosalpinx in the avascular area and then a section of tube was clamped off with two hemostats and then transected with the Metzenbaum scissors The ends was then burned with the cautery and then using a 2 0 Vicryl suture tied down Both tube sections were noted to be hemostatic and the tubes were then sent to pathology for review The uterus was then replaced back into the abdomen The gutters were cleared of all clots and debris The uterine incision was then once again inspected and noted to be hemostatic The bladder flap was then replaced back into the uterus with 3 0 interrupted sutures The peritoneum was then closed with 3 0 Vicryl in a running fashion Then the area at the fascia where

Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity of proximal phalanx right foot ANESTHESIA Local infiltrate with IV sedation INDICATION FOR SURGERY The patient has had a longstanding history of foot problems The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative treatment The preoperative discussion with the patient included the alternative treatment options The procedure was explained in detail and risk factors such as infection swelling scarred tissue numbness continued pain recurrence and postoperative management were explained in detail The patient has been advised although no guaranty for success could be given most patients have improved function and less pain All questions were thoroughly answered The patient requested surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interferes with her normal daily activities The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort DETAILS OF PROCEDURE The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position No tourniquet was utilized IV sedation was administered and during that time local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in a 1 1 mixture of 0 25 Marcaine and 1 lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner Balanced anesthesia was obtained PROCEDURE 1 Distal metaphyseal osteotomy with internal screw fixation with bunionectomy right foot A dorsal curvilinear incision medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon was made extending from the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal to a point midway on the shaft of the proximal phalanx Care was taken to identify and retract the vital structures and when necessary vessels were ligated via electrocautery Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue superficial fascia and then down to the capsular and periosteal layer which was visualized A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision The capsular tissue and periosteal layer were underscored free from its underlying osseous attachments and they refracted to expose the osseous surface Inspection revealed increased first intermetatarsal angle and hypertrophic changes to the first metatarsal head The head of the first metatarsal was dissected free from its attachment medially and dorsally delivered dorsally and may be into the wound Inspection revealed the first metatarsophalangeal joint surface appeared to be in satisfactory condition The sesamoid was in satisfactory condition An oscillating saw was utilized to resect the hypertrophic portion of the first metatarsal head to remove the normal and functional configuration Care was taken to preserve the sagittal groove The rough edges were then smoothed with a rasp Attention was then focused on the medial mid portion of the first metatarsal head where a K wire access guide was positioned to define the apex and direction of displacement for the capital fragment The access guide was noted to be in good position A horizontally placed through and through osteotomy with the apex distal and the base proximal was completed The short plantar arm was from the access guide to proximal plantar and the long dorsal arm was from the access guide to proximal dorsal The capital fragment was distracted off the first metatarsal moved laterally to decrease the intermetatarsal angle to create a more anatomical and functional position of the first metatarsal head The capital fragment was impacted upon the metatarsal Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the intermetatarsal angle and good alignment of the capital fragment It was then fixated with 1 screw A guide pin was directed from the dorsal aspect of the capital fragment to the plantar aspect of the shaft and first metatarsal in a distal dorsal to proximal plantar direction The length was measured mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured in position Compression and fixation were noted to be satisfactory Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the operative site Attention was then directed to the medial portion of the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal where an oscillating saw was used to resect the small portion of the bone that was created by shifting the capital fragment laterally All rough edges were rasped smooth Examination revealed there was still lateral deviation of the hallux A second procedure the reposition osteotomy of the proximal phalanx with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity was indicated PROCEDURE 2 Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity proximal phalanx right hallux The original skin incision was extended from the point just distal to the interphalangeal joint All vital structures were identified and retracted Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue superficial fascia and down to the periosteal layer which was underscored free from its underlying osseous attachments and reflected to expose the osseous surface The focus of the deformity was noted to be more distal on the hallux Utilizing an oscillating saw a more distal wedge shaped transverse oblique osteotomy was made with the apex being proximal and lateral and the base medial distal was affected The proximal phalanx was then placed in appropriate alignment and stabilized with a guide pin which was then measured 14 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the osteotomy site The alignment and contour of the first way was now satisfactorily improved The entire surgical wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline irrigation The periosteal and capsular layer was closed with running sutures of 3 0 Vicryl The subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4 0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted well with 4 0 nylon with running simples reinforced with Steri Strips Approximately 6 mL total in a 1 1 mixture of 0 25 Marcaine and 1 lidocaine plain was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site for postoperative anesthesia A dressing consisting of Adaptic and 4 x 4 was applied to the

sinus rhythm good biventricular function by visual inspection PROCEDURE After the informed consent the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating room table in supine position Upon induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of indwelling arterial and venous monitoring lines The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion from chin to groins A median sternotomy incision was performed Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw A subtotal thymectomy was performed Systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle A small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure Pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right Atrial appendage The aorta was then cannulated with an 8 French aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18 French Polystan right angle cannula With an ACT greater than 400 greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2 0 silk tie Systemic cooling was started and the head was packed and iced and systemic steroids were administered During cooling traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle After 25 minutes of cooling the aorta was cross clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter kilogram of cold blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross clamping Following successful cardioplegic arrest a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10 French catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18 French Polystan venous cannula The heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed It was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed The two openings were then anastomosed in an end to side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7 0 PDS suture Following completion of the anastomosis the heart was returned into the chest and the patient s blood volume was drained into the reservoir A right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest The atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6 0 Prolene suture The usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6 0 Prolene sutures The venous cannula was reinserted Cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross clamp was released The patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which following a prolonged period of rewarming allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm Modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15 French Blake drains Venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate All cannulation sites were oversewn with 6 0 Prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic With good hemodynamics and hemostasis the sternum

"Health1276","PROCEDURE PERFORMED 1 Left heart catheterization with coronary angiography vein graft angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement and angiography 2 Right femoral selective angiogram 3 Closure device the seal the femoral arteriotomy using an Angio Seal INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE The patient with known coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and multiple risk factors of coronary disease who had her last coronary arteriogram performed in 2004 She has had complaints of progressive chest discomfort and has ongoing risks including current smoking diabetes hypertension hyperlipidemia to name a few The decision was made to proceed on with percutaneous evaluation and possible intervention given her known disease and the possibility of disease progression DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE After informed consent was obtained The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization lab where her procedure was performed She was prepped and prepared on the table after which her right groin was locally anesthetized with 1 lidocaine Then a 6 French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery over a standard 0 035 guide wire Coronary angiography and left ventricular measurement and angiography were performed using a 6 French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery A 6 French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right groin and her artery and the saphenous vein graft conduit Subsequently a 6 French angled pigtail catheter was used to measure left ventricular pressures and to perform a power injection a left ventriculogram at 8 mL per second for a total of 30 mL At the conclusion of the diagnostic evaluation the patient had selective arteriography of her right femoral artery which showed the right femoral artery to be free of significant atherosclerotic plaque Did have a normal bifurcation into the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries and to have an arteriotomy that was in the common femoral artery away from the bifurcation As such an initial attempt to advance a Perclose device failed to allow the device descend to tract and into the appropriate position within the artery As such the Perclose was never deployed and was removed intact over the wire from the system We then replaced this with a 6 French Angio Seal which was used to seal the femoral arteriotomy with achievement of hemostasis The patient was subsequently dispositioned back to the MAC Unit where she will complete her bedrest prior to her disposition to home HEMODYNAMIC DATA Opening aortic pressure 125 60 left ventricular pressure 108 4 with an end diastolic pressure of 16 There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve on pullback from the left ventricle Left ventricular ejection fraction was 55 Mitral regurgitation was less than or equal to 1 There was normal wall motion in the RAO projection CORONARY ANGIOGRAM The left main coronary artery had mild atherosclerotic plaque The proximal LAD was 100 occluded The left circumflex had mild diffuse atherosclerotic plaque The obtuse marginal branch which operates as an OM 2 had a mid approximately 80 stenosis at a kink in the artery This appears to be the area of a prior anastomosis the saphenous vein graft to the OM This is a very small caliber vessel and is 1 5 mm in diameter at best The right coronary artery is dominant The native right coronary artery had mild proximal and mid atherosclerotic plaque The distal right coronary artery has an approximate 40 stenosis The posterior left ventricular branch has a proximal 50 to 60 stenosis The proximal PDA has a 40 to 50 stenosis The saphenous vein graft to the right PDA is widely patent There was competitive flow noted between the native right coronary artery and the saphenous vein graft to the PDA The runoff from the PDA is nice with the native proximal PDA and PLV disease as noted above There is also some retrograde filling of the right coronary artery from the runoff of this graft The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending is widely patent The LAD beyond the distal anastomosis is a relatively small caliber vessel There is some retrograde filling that allows some filling into a more proximal diagonal branch The saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal was known to be occluded from the prior study in 2004 Overall this study does not look markedly different than the procedure performed in 2004 CONCLUSION 100 proximal LAD mild left circumflex disease with an OM that is a small caliber vessel with an 80 lesion at a kink that is no amenable to percutaneous intervention The native right coronary artery has mild to moderate distal disease with moderate PLV and PDA disease The saphenous vein graft to the OM is known to be 100 occluded The saphenous vein graft to the PDA and the saphenous vein graft to the LAD are open Normal left ventricular systolic function PLAN The plan will be for continued medical therapy and risk factor modification Aggressive antihyperlipidemic and antihypertensive control The patient s goal LDL will be at or below 70 with triglyceride level at or below 150 and it is very imperative that the patient stop smoking After her bedrest is complete she will be dispositioned to home after which she will be following up with me in the office within 1 month We will also plan to perform a carotid duplex Doppler ultrasound to

study She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea She refuses this I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better I did x ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes it was unremarkable I reviewed this with her I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding while this is not real unusual for her with her family history of colon cancer I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr XYZ and leave further studies up to them I will dictate Dr XYZ a note I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her This however has been some time ago I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome I have strongly encouraged weight reduction both through diet and exercise I would like to see her back in the office in six months I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130 70 She is fasting this morning so we will get a fasting blood sugar chem 12 lipid profile and CPK I will her mail the results I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated I think she is amenable to this Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04 09 03 I do not

"Health1318","REASON FOR REFERRAL Ms A is a 60 year old African American female with 12 years of education who was referred for neuropsychological evaluation by Dr X after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in July A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with Ms A A summary of pertinent information is presented below Please refer to the patient s medical chart for a more complete history HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM Ms A presented to the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07 26 2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand slurred speech and left facial droop Neurological evaluation with Dr X confirmed left hemiparesis Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left sided weakness These symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20 to 30 stenosis of the right ICA and 0 to 19 stenosis of the left ICA On 07 29 2009 she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA CVA At discharge on 08 06 2009 she was mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane She was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy She returned to the Sinai ER on 08 2009 2009 due to reported left arm pain numbness and weakness which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt just like the stroke Brain CT on 08 2009 2009 was read as showing mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan Neurological examination with Dr Y was within normal limits but she was admitted for a more extensive workup Due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity but it did not show deep vein thrombosis Followup CT on 08 10 2009 showed no significant interval change MRI could not be completed due to the patient s weight She was discharged on 08 11 2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin however note that Ms A referred to this as a second stroke Ms A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr X on 09 22 2009 at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted She demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming abstract verbal reasoning and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full time work duty During the current interview Ms A reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations events and at times forgetting to take her medications She also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation solving novel problems and tasks e g difficulty learning to use her camcorder but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention concentration language or other areas of cognitive functioning When asked about her return to

evaluation with Dr X confirmed left hemiparesis Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left sided weakness These symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20 to 30 stenosis of the right ICA and 0 to 19 stenosis of the left ICA On 07 29 2009 she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA CVA At discharge on

physical therapy She returned to the Sinai ER on 08 2009 2009 due to reported left arm pain numbness and weakness which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt just like the stroke Brain CT on 08 2009 2009 was read as showing mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan Neurological examination with Dr Y was within normal limits but she was admitted for a more extensive workup Due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity but it did not show deep vein thrombosis Followup CT on 08 10 2009 showed no significant interval change MRI could not be completed due to the patient s weight She was discharged on 08 11 2009 in stable condition after it was

had worsening bunion deformity for as long as she could not remember She does have a history of Charcot Marie tooth disease and desires surgical treatment at this time PROCEDURE An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia a total of 15 cc of 1 1 mixture of 1 lidocaine plain and 0 5 Marcaine plain were injected in a Mayo block type fashion surrounding the lower left first metatarsal The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating field The stockinette was reflected the foot was cleansed with a wet and dry sponge Approximately 5 cm incision was made dorsomedially over the first metatarsal The incision was then deepened with 15 blade All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis Care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon The capsule over the first metatarsal phalangeal then was identified where a dorsal capsular incision was then created down to the level of bone Capsule and periosteum was reflected off the first metatarsal head At this time the cartilage was inspected and noted to be white shiny and healthy cartilage There was noted to be a prominent medial eminence Attention was then directed to first interspace where a combination of blunt and sharp dissection was done to perform a standard lateral release The abductor tendon attachments were identified and transected The lateral capsulotomy was performed The extensor digitorum brevis tendon was identified and transected Attention was then directed to the prominent medial eminence which was resected with a sagittal saw Intraoperative assessment of pes was performed and pes was noted to be normal At this time a regional incision was carried more approximately about 1 5 cm The capsular incision was then extended and the proximal capsule and periosteum were reflected off the first metatarsal The first metatarsal cuneiform joint was identified A 0 45 K wire was then inserted into the base of the first metatarsal approximately 1 cm from the first cuneiform joint perpendicular to the weightbearing surface This K wire was used as an access guide for a Juvaro type oblique base wedge osteotomy The sagittal saw was then used to creat a closing base wedge osteotomy with the apex being proximal medial The osteotomy site was then feathered and tilted with tight estimation of the bony edges The cortical hinge was maintained A 0 27 x 24 mm screw was then inserted in a standard AO fashion At this time there was noted to be tight compression of the osteotomy site A second 2 7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted more distally in the standard AO fashion with compression noted The angle was noted to be significantly released Reciprocating rasp was then used to smoothen any remaining sharp edges The 0 45 k wire was removed The foot was loaded and was noted to fill the remaining abduction of the hallux At this time it was incised to perform an Akin osteotomy Original incision was then extended distally approximately 1 cm The incision was then deepened down to the level of capsule over the base of the proximal phalanx Again care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon The capsule was reflected off of the base of the proximal phalanx An Akin osteotomy was performed with the apex being lateral and the base being medial After where the bone was resected it was feathered until tight compression was noted without tension at the osteotomy site Care was taken to preserve the lateral hinge At 1 5 wire passed and a drill was then used to create drill hole proximal and distally to the osteotomy site in order for passage of 28 gauge monofilament wire The 28 gauge monofilament wire was passed through the drill hole and tightened down until compression and tight osteotomy site was noted The remaining edge of the wire was then buried in the medial most distal drill hole The area was then inspected and the foot was noted with significant reduction of the bunion deformity The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline Capsule was closed with 3 0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with 4 0 Vicryl in order to decrease tension of the incision site A running 5 0 subcuticular stitch was then performed Steri Strips were applied Total of 1 cc dexamethasone phosphate was then injected into the surgical site Dressings consisted of Owen silk 4x4s Kling Kerlix The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot Posterior splint was then placed on the patient in the operating room The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications The patient was transferred back to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot The patient was given postoperative instructions to be strictly nonweightbearing on the left foot The

Implantation of antibiotic beads left shoulder INDICATION FOR SURGERY The patient was seen multiple times preoperatively and found to have findings consistent with a chronic and indolent infections Risks and benefits have been discussed with him and his family at length including but not exclusive of continued infection nerve or artery damage stiffness loss of range of motion incomplete relief of pain incomplete return of function fractures loss of bone medical complications surgical complications transfusion related complications etc The patient understood and wished to proceed PREOP DIAGNOSIS Presumed infection left total shoulder arthroplasty POSTOP DIAGNOSES 1 Deep extensive infection left total shoulder arthroplasty 2 Biceps tenosynovitis 3 Massive rotator cuff tear in left shoulder full thickness subscapularis tendon rupture 3 cm x 4 cm supraspinatus tendon rupture 3 cm x 3 cm infraspinatus tear 2 cm x 2 cm DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE The patient was anesthetized in the supine position a Foley catheter was placed in his bladder He was then placed Beach chair position and all bony prominences were well padded Pillows were placed around his knees to protect his sciatic nerve He was brought to the side of the table and secured with towels and tape The head was placed in neutral position with no lateral bending or extension to protect the brachioplexus from any stretch Left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion Unfortunately preoperative antibiotics were given prior to the procedure This occurred due to lack of communication between the surgical staff and the anesthesia staff The patient s extremity however was prepped a second time with a chlorhexidine prep after he had been draped Also Ioban bandages were placed securely to the skin to prevent any further introduction of infection into his shoulder Deltopectoral incision was then made The patient s had a cephalic vein it was identified and protected throughout the case It was retracted laterally and once this has been completed the deltopectoral interval was developed as carefully as possible The patient did have significant scar from this point on and did bleed from many surfaces throughout the case As a result he was transfused 1 unit postoperatively He did not have any problems during the case except for one small drop of blood pressure However this was due primarily because of the extensive scarring of his proximal humerus He had scar between the anterior capsular structures and the conjoint tendon Also there was significant scar between the deltoid and the proximal humerus The deltoid was very carefully and tediously removed from the proximal humerus in order not to damage the axillary nerve Once the plane between the deltoid and underlying tissue was found the proximal humerus was discovered to have a large defect approximately 4 x 3 This was covered by rimmed fibrous tissue which was fairly compressible which felt to be purulent however when the needle was stuck into this area there was no return of fluid As a result this was finally opened and found to have fibrinous exudates which appeared to be old congealed purulent material There was some suggestion of a synovitis type reaction also inside this cystic area This was all debrided but was found to track all the way into the proximal humerus from the lateral femoral component and also tracked posteriorly through and around the posterior cortex of the proximal humerus indicating that the infraspinatus probably had some tearing and detachment This later proved to be the case and infraspinatus did indeed have a tear 2 cm x 2 cm All of the mucinous material and fibrinous material was removed from the proximal humerus This was fairly extensive debridement All of this was sent to pathology and also sent for culture and sensitivity It should be noted that Gram stain became as multiple white blood cells but no organism seen The pathology came back as fibrinous material with multiple white cells also with signs of chronic inflammation consistent with an infection Attention was then directed towards the anterior structures to gain access to the joint so that we could dislocate the prosthesis and remove it There was also cystic area in the anterior aspect of the shoulder which was fairly fibrinous This was also removed Once this was removed though the capsule was found to be very thin there was essentially no subscapularis tendon whatsoever It should also noted the patient s proximal humerus was subluxed superiorly so that there was no supraspinatus tendon present whatsoever As a result the biceps tendon was finally identified just below the pectoralis tendon insertion The upper 1 or 2 cm of the pectoralis insertion was released in order to find the biceps It was tracked proximally and transverse ligament released The biceps tendon was flat and somewhat erythematous As a result it released and tagged with an 0 Vicryl suture It was later tenodesed to the conjoint tendon using 2 0 Prolene sutures The joint was then entered and noted significant synovitis throughout the entire glenoid This was all very carefully removed using a rongeur and sharp dissection Next the humeral component was removed and this was done by attempting to remove it with the slap hammer and device which comes with the Biomet set Unfortunately this device would not hold the proximal humerus and we could not get the component to release As a result bone contact of the metal proximally was released using a straight osteotome Once this was completed another attempt was made to remove the prosthesis but this only resulted in fracture of the proximal humerus through the areas of erosion of the infection and once this has been completed we abandoned use of that particular device and using a we were able to hit the prosthesis lip from beneath and essentially remove it There was no cement There was exudate within the canal which was removed using a curette Using fluoroscopy sequential reamers were placed to a size of 11 distally down the shaft to remove the exudate This was also thoroughly irrigated with irrigation antibiotic and impregnated irrigation to decrease any risk of infection It should be noted that the reaming was done fluoroscopically to make sure that there was no penetration of the canal at any point The attention was then directed to the glenoid The glenoid component was very carefully dissected free and found to be very loose It was essentially removed with digital dissection There was no remaining cement in the cavity itself The patient s glenoid was very carefully debrided The glenoid itself was found to be very cup shaped with significant amount of bone loss in the central portion of the canal itself This was debrided using rongeurs and curette until there was no purulent exudate present anywhere in the glenoid itself Next the entire wound was irrigated thoroughly with 9 liters of antibiotic impregnated irrigation Rather than place a spacer it was elected to use antiobiotic beads This was with antibiotic impregnated cement with one package with 3 gram of vancomycin These beads were then connected using Prolene and placed into the glenoid cavity itself also some were placed in the greater tuberosity region These three did not have a Prolene attached to them The ones placed down the canal did have a Prolene used as did the ones placed in the cavity of the glenoid itself The biceps tendon was then tenodesed under tension to the conjoint tendon There was essentially no capsule left purely to close over the proximal humerus It was electively the proximal humerus A portion of bone intact because it did have some bleeding surfaces Deltopectoral was then closed with 0 Vicryl sutures the deep subcutaneous tissues with 0 Vicryl sutures superficial subcutaneous tissues with 2 0 Vicryl sutures Skin was closed with staples A sterile bandage was applied along with a cold therapy device and shoulder immobilizer The patient was sent to recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition It should be noted that is being requested for this case This was a significantly scarred patient which required extra dissection and attention Even though this was a standard revision case due to infection there was a significant more decision making and technical challenges in this case and this was present for typical revision case Similarly this case took approximately 30 to 40 more length of time due to bleeding and the attention to hemostasis The blood loss and operative findings indicates that this case was at least 30 to 40 more challenging than a standard total shoulder or revision case This is being dictated for insurance purposes only and reflects no inherent difficulties with the case whatsoever"

lysis of adhesions 3 Right salpingo oophorectomy ANESTHESIA General ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS 200 mL SPECIMENS Right tube and ovary COMPLICATIONS None FINDINGS Extensive adhesive disease with the omentum and bowel walling of the entire pelvis which required more than 45 minutes of operating time in order to establish visualization and to clear the bowel and other important structures from the ovarian cyst tube and ovary in order to remove them The large and small bowels were completely enveloping a large right ovarian cystic mass Normal anatomy was difficult to see due to adhesions Cyst was ruptured incidentally intraoperatively with approximately 150 mL to 200 mL of turbid fluid Cyst wall tube and ovary were stripped away from the bowel Posterior peritoneum was also removed in order to completely remove the cyst wall ovary and tube There was excellent postoperative hemostasis PROCEDURE The patient was taken to the operating room where general anesthesia was achieved without difficulty She was then placed in a dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion A vertical midline incision was made from the umbilicus and extended to the symphysis pubis along the line of the patient s prior incision Incision was carried down carefully until the peritoneal cavity was reached Care was taken upon entry of the peritoneum to avoid injury of underlying structures At this point the extensive adhesive disease was noted again requiring greater than 45 minutes of dissection in order to visualize the intended anatomy for surgery The omentum was carefully stripped away from the patient s right side developing a window This was extended down along the inferior portion of the incision removing the omentum from its adhesions to the anterior peritoneum and what appears to be the vesicouterine peritoneum A large mass of bowel was noted to be adherent to itself causing a quite tortuous course Adhesiolysis was performed in order to free up the bowel in order to pack it out of the pelvis Excellent hemostasis was noted The bowel was then packed over of the pelvis allowing visualization of a matted mass of large and small bowel surrounding a large ovarian cyst Careful adhesive lysis and dissection enabled the colon to be separated from the posterior wall of the cyst Small bowel and portion of the colon were adherent anteriorly on the cyst and during the dissection of these to remove them from their attachment the cyst was ruptured Large amount of turbid fluid was noted and was evacuated The cyst wall was then carefully placed under tension and stripped away from the patient s small and large bowel Once the bowel was freed the remnants of round ligament was identified elevated and the peritoneum was incised opening the retroperitoneal space The retroperitoneal space was opened following the line of the ovarian vessels which were identified and elevated and a window made inferior to the ovarian vessels but superior to the course of the ureter This pedicle was doubly clamped transected and tied with a free tie of 2 0 Vicryl A suture ligature of 0 Vicryl was used to obtain hemostasis Excellent hemostasis was noted at this pedicle The posterior peritoneum and portion of the remaining broad ligament were carefully dissected and shelled out to remove the tube and ovary which was still densely adherent to the peritoneum Care was taken at the side of the remnant of the uterine vessels However a laceration of the uterine vessels did occur which was clamped with a right angle clamp and carefully sutured ligated with excellent hemostasis noted Remainder of the specimen was then shelled out including portions of the posterior and sidewall peritoneum and removed The opposite tube and ovary were identified were also matted behind a large amount of large bowel and completely enveloped and wrapped in the fallopian tube Minimal dissection was performed in order to ascertain and ensure that the ovary appeared completely normal It was then left in situ Hemostasis was achieved in the pelvis with the use of electrocautery The abdomen and pelvis were copiously irrigated with warm saline solution The peritoneal edges were inspected and found to have good hemostasis after the side of the uterine artery pedicle and the ovarian vessel pedicle The areas of the bowel had previously been dissected and due to adhesive disease it was carefully inspected and excellent hemostasis was noted All instruments and packs removed from the patient s abdomen The abdomen was closed with a running mattress closure of 0 PDS beginning at the superior aspect of the incision and extending inferiorly Excellent closure of the incision was noted The subcutaneous tissues were then copiously irrigated Hemostasis was achieved with the use of cautery Subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated to close the edge space with a several interrupted sutures of 0 plain gut suture The skin was closed with staples Incision was sterilely clean and dressed The patient was awakened from general anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition All counts were noted correct times three"

ANESTHESIA Demerol 50 mg with Versed 3 mg as well as topical cocaine and lidocaine solution LOCATION OF PROCEDURE Endoscopy suite 4 After informed consent was obtained and following the review of the procedure including procedure as well as possible risks and complications were explained and consent was previously obtained the patient was sedated with the above stated medication and the patient was continuously monitored on pulse oximetry noninvasive blood pressure and EKG monitoring Prior to starting the procedure the patient was noted to have a baseline oxygen saturation of 86 on room air Subsequently she was given a bronchodilator treatment with Atrovent and albuterol and subsequent saturation increased to approximately 90 to 91 on room air The patient was placed on a supplemental oxygen as the patient was sedated with above stated medication As this occurred the bronchoscope was inserted into the right naris with good visualization of the nasopharynx and oropharynx The cords were noted to oppose bilaterally on phonation There was some slight mucosal irregularity noted on the vocal cord on the left side Additional topical lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords at which point the bronchoscope was introduced into the trachea which was midline in nature The bronchoscope was then advanced to the distal trachea and additional lidocaine was instilled At this time the bronchoscope was further advanced through the main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled Bronchoscope was then further advanced into the right upper lobe which revealed no evidence of any endobronchial lesion The mucosa was diffusely friable throughout Bronchoscope was then slowly withdrawn into the right main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled At this point the bronchoscope was then advanced to the right bronchus intermedius At this time it was noted that there was severe mucosal irregularities of nodular in appearance significantly narrowing the right lower lobe and right middle lobe opening The mucosal area throughout this region was severely friable Additional lidocaine was instilled as well as topical epinephrine At this time bronchoscope was maintained in this region and endobronchial biopsies were performed At the initial attempt of inserting biopsy forceps some resistance was noted within the proximal channel at this time making advancement of the biopsy forceps out of the proximal channel impossible So the biopsy forceps was withdrawn and the bronchoscope was completely withdrawn and new bronchoscope was then utilized At this time bronchoscope was then reinserted into the right naris and subsequently advanced to the vocal cords into the right bronchus intermedius without difficulty At this time the biopsy forceps were easily passed and visualized in the right bronchus intermedius At this time multiple mucosal biopsies were performed with some mild oozing noted Several aliquots of normal saline lavage followed After completion of multiple biopsies there was good hemostasis Cytology flushing was also performed in this region and subsequently several aliquots of additional normal saline lavage was followed Bronchoscope was unable to be passed distally to the base of the segment of the right lower lobe or distal to the further visualized endobronchial anatomy of the right middle lobe subsegments The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the distal trachea At this time bronchoscope was then advanced to the left main stem Additional lidocaine was instilled The bronchoscope was advanced to the left upper and lower lobe subsegments There was no endobronchial lesion visualized There is mild diffuse erythema and fibromucosa was noted throughout No endobronchial lesion was visualized in the left bronchial system The bronchoscope was then subsequently further withdrawn to the distal trachea and readvanced into the right bronchial system At this time bronchoscope was readvanced into the right bronchus intermedius and additional aliquots of normal saline lavage until cleared There is no gross bleeding evidenced at this time or diffuse mucosal erythema and edema present throughout The bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn and the patient was sent to recovery room During the bronchoscopy the patient noted have desaturation and required increasing FiO2 with subsequent increased saturation to 93 to 94 The patient remained at this level of saturation or greater throughout the remaining of the procedure The patient postprocedure relates having some intermittent hemoptysis prior to the procedure as well as moderate exertional dyspnea This was confirmed by her daughter and mother who were also present at the bedside postprocedure The patient did receive a nebulizer bronchodilator treatment immediately prebronchoscopy and postprocedure as well The patient also admitted to continued smoking in spite of all of the above The patient was extensively counseled regarding the continued smoking especially with her present symptoms She was advised regarding smoking cessation The patient was also placed on a prescription of prednisone 2 mg tablets starting at 40 mg a day decreasing every three days to continue to wean off The patient was also administered Solu Medrol 60 mg IV x1 in recovery room There was no significant bronchospastic component noted although because of the severity of the mucosal edema erythema and her complaints short course of steroids will be instituted The patient was also advised to refrain from using any aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medication because of her hemoptysis At this time the patient was also advised that if hemoptysis were to continue or worsen or develop progressive dyspnea to either contact myself or return to ABCD Emergency

cephalic presentation Apgars 9 9 Birth weight 6 pounds 14 ounces Infant suctioned with a bulb upon delivery of the head and body Cord clamped and cut and infant passed to pediatric team present Complete placenta manually extracted intact with three vessel cord Extensive anterior abdominal wall adhesions with the anterior abdominal wall completely adhered to the anterior uterus throughout its entire length of the incision In addition the bladder was involved in adhesion mass complex A window was developed surgically at the apical aspect of the incision enabling finger to pass to get behind the dense anterior abdominal wall adhesions These adhesions were surgically transected using Bovie cautery technique freeing up the anterior uterine attachment from the anterior abdominal wall Upon initial entry through the fibrous layer of the anterior abdominal wall into the serosal and slightly muscular part of the anterior uterus due to the dense adhesion attachment that had occurred from previous surgeries Bilateral tubal ligation performed without difficulty via Parkland technique ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS 500 mL COMPLICATIONS None URINE OUTPUT Per anesthesia records Urine cleared postoperatively IV FLUIDS Per anesthesia records The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition with stable vital signs OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE The patient was placed in a supine position after spinal epidural anesthesia She was prepped and draped in the usual manner for repeat cesarean section A sharp knife was used to make a Pfannenstiel skin incision at the site of the previous scar This was carried through the subcutaneous tissue into the dense fibromuscular and fascial layer with a sharp knife This incision was extended laterally with Mayo scissors Dense fibromuscular layer was encountered from the patient s previous surgeries Upon entry incision was entered into the serosal and partial muscular layer of the anterior uterus and there was no free area to enter into the peritoneal cavity due to dense fibromuscular adhesions of the entire uterus to the anterior abdominal wall at the length of the incision Fascia was previously separated superiorly and inferiorly from the muscular layer A surgical window was created at the apical aspect of the incision in the direction of the uterine fundus Finger was able to be passed and placed behind the dense adhesions between the uterus through anterior abdominal wall This adhesion complex was transacted via Bovie cautery its entire length circumferentially freeing the uterus from its attachment to anterior abdominal wall Inferiorly difficulty was encountered with adhesion separation involving the bladder additionally to the uterus and the anterior abdominal wall These adhesions likewise were surgically transacted via sharp blunt and electrocautery dissection This was successfully done without anterior entry into the bladder Smooth pickups and Metzenbaum scissors were then used to do sharp dissection to separated the bladder from its attachment to the lower uterine segment enabling the vesicouterine peritoneal reflection for incision of the uterus The uterus was then incised using a sharp knife and low transverse incision This was extended with bandage scissors The infant was delivered easily from a cephalic presentation Bulb suction was done following

resection 3 Flexible colonoscopy 4 Transverse loop colostomy and JP placement ANESTHESIA General HISTORY This 74 year old female who had a recent hip fracture and the patient was in rehab when she started having some stool coming out of the urethra The patient had retrograde cystogram which revealed colovesical fistula Recommendation for a surgery was made The patient was explained the risks and benefits as well as the two sons and the daughter They understood that the patient can even die from this procedure All the three procedures were explained without a colostomy with Hartmann s colostomy and with a transverse loop colostomy and out of the three procedures the patient s requested to have the loop colostomy and stated that the Hartmann s colostomy leaving the anastomosis with the risk of leaking PROCEDURE DETAILS The patient was taken to the operating room prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and was given general anesthetic An incision was performed in the midline below the umbilicus to the pubis with a 10 blade Bard Parker Electrocautery was used for hemostasis down to the fascia The fascia was grasped with Ochsner s and then immediately the peritoneum was entered and the incision was carried cephalad and caudad with electrocautery Once within the peritoneum adhesiolysis was performed to separate the small bowel from the attachment of the anterior abdominal wall At this point immediately a small bowel was retracted cephalad The patient was taken to a slightly Trendelenburg position and the descending colon was seen The white line of Toldt was opened all the way down to the area of inflammation At this point meticulous dissection was carried to separate the small bowel from the attachment to the abscess When the small bowel was completely freed of abscess bulk of the bladder was seen anteriorly to the uterus The abscess was cultured and sent it back to Bacteriology Department and immediately the opening into the bladder was visualized At this point the entire sigmoid colon was separated posteriorly as well as laterally and it was all the way down to sigmoid down to the rectum At this point decision to place a moist towel and retract old intestine superiorly as well as to place first self retaining retractor in the abdominal cavity with a bladder blade was placed Immediately a GIA was fired right across the descending colon and sigmoid colon junction and then with peons within the mesentery were placed all the way down to the rectosigmoid junction where a TA 55 balloon Roticulator was fired The specimen was cut with 10 blade Bard Parker and sent it to Pathology Immediately copious amount of irrigation was used and the staple line in the descending colon was brought with Allis A pursestring device was fired The staple line was cut The dilators were used using 25 and 29 then 29 EEA was placed and the suture was tied At this point attention was directed down to the rectal stump where dilators 25 and 29 were passed from the anus into the rectum and then the 29 Ethicon GIA was introduced The spike came posteriorly through the staple line to avoid the inflammatory process anteriorly that was present in the area of the cul de sac as well as the uterine was present in this patient Immediately the EEA was connected with a mushroom It was tied fired and a Doyen was placed above the anastomosis approximately four inches Fluid was placed within the and immediately a colonoscope was introduced from the patient s anus insufflating air No air was seen evolving from the staple line All fluid was removed and pictures of the staple line were taken The scope was removed at this point The case was passed to Dr X for repair of the vesicle fistula Dr X did repair down the perforation of the bladder that was communicating with an abscess secondary to the perforated diverticulitis and the colon After this was performed copious amount of irrigation was used again More lysis of adhesions were performed and decision to make a loop transverse colostomy was made to protect the anastomosis in a phase of a severe inflammatory process in the pelvis in the infected area The incision was performed in the right upper quadrant This incision was performed with cutting in the cautery down into the fascia splitting the muscle and then the Penrose was passed under transverse colon and was grasped on pulling the transverse colon at the level of the skin The wire was passed under the transverse colon It was left in place Moderate irrigation was used in the peritoneal cavity and in the right lower quadrant a JP was placed in the pelvis posteriorly to the abscess cavity that was down on the pelvis At this point immediately yellow fluid was removed from the peritoneal cavity and the abdomen was closed with cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad with a loop PDS suture and then tied Electrocautery for hemostasis and the subcutaneous tissue Copious amount of irrigation was used The skin was approximated with staples At this point immediately the wound was covered with a moist towel and decision to mature the loop colostomy was made The colostomy was opened longitudinally and then matured with interrupted 3 0 Vicryl suture through the skin edge One it was completely matured immediately the index finger was probed proximally and distally and both loops were completely opened As previously mentioned the Penrose was removed and the Bard was secured with a 3 0 nylon suture The JP was secured with 3 0 nylon suture as well At this point dressings were applied The patient tolerated the procedure well The stent from the left ureter was removed and the Foley was left in place The patient did tolerate the procedure well and will be followed up during the hospitalization"

left chest wall tumor partial resection of left diaphragm left lower lobe lung wedge resection left chest wall reconstruction with Gore Tex mesh ANESTHESIA General endotracheal SPECIMEN Left chest wall with tumor and left lower lobe lung wedge resection to pathology INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE The patient is a 79 year old male who began to experience back pain approximately 2 years ago which increased Chest x ray and CT scan revealed a 3 cm x 4 cm mass abutting the left chest wall inferior to the left scapula with pleural thickening A biopsy was performed at an outside hospital Kaiser and pathology was consistent with mesothelioma The patient had a metastatic workup which was negative including a brain MRI and bone scan The bone scan showed only signal positivity in the left 9th rib near the tumor The patient has a significant past medical history consisting of coronary artery disease hypertension non insulin dependent diabetes longstanding atrial fibrillation anemia and hypercholesterolemia He and his family were apprised of the high risk nature of this surgery preoperatively and informed consent was obtained PROCEDURE IN DETAIL The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position The patient was intubated with a double lumen endotracheal tube Intravenous antibiotics were given A Foley catheter was placed The patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position and the left chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion An incision approximately 8 inches long was made centered over the mass and extending slightly obliquely over the mass The skin and subcutaneous tissues were dissected sharply with the electrocautery Good hemostasis was obtained The tumor was easily palpable and clearly involving the 8th to 9th rib A thoracotomy was initially made above the mass in approximately the 7th intercostal space Inspection of the pleural cavity revealed multiple adhesions which were taken down with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection The thoracotomy was extended anteriorly and posteriorly It was clear that in order to obtain an adequate resection of the tumor approximately 4 rib segment of the chest wall would need to be resected The ribs of the chest wall were first cut at their anterior aspect The ribs 7 8 9 and 10 were serially transected after the interspaces were dissected with electrocautery Hemostasis was obtained with both electrocautery and clips The chest wall segment to be resected was retracted laterally and posteriorly It was clear that there were at least 2 areas where the tumor was invading the lung and a lengthy area of diaphragmatic involvement Inferiorly the diaphragm was divided to provide a margin of at least 1 to 2 cm around the areas of tumor The spleen and the stomach were identified and were protected Inferiorly the resection of the chest wall was continued in the 10th interspace The dissection was then carried posteriorly to the level of the spine The left lung at this point was further dissected out and multiple firings of the GIA 75 were used to perform a wedge resection of the left lower lobe which provided a complete resection of all palpable and visible tumor in the lung A 2 0 silk tie was used to ligate the last remaining corner of lung parenchyma at the corner of the wedge resection Posteriorly the chest wall segment was noted to have an area at the level of approximately T8 and T9 where the tumor involved the vertebral bodies The ribs were disarticulated closed to or at their articulations with the spine Bleeding from the intercostal vessels was controlled with a combination of clips and electrocautery There was no disease grossly involving or encasing the aorta The posterior transection of the ribs was completed and the specimen was passed off of the field as a specimen to pathology for permanent section The specimen was oriented for the pathologist who came to the room Hemostasis was obtained The vent in the diaphragm was then closed primarily with a series of figure of 8 1 Ethibond sutures This produced a satisfactory diaphragmatic repair without undue tension A single 32 French chest tube was placed in the pleural cavity exiting the left hemithorax anteriorly This was secured with a 1 silk suture The Gore Tex mesh was brought on to the field and was noted to be of adequate size to patch the resulting chest wall defect A series of 1 Prolene were placed in an interrupted horizontal mattress fashion circumferentially and tied down individually The resulting mesh closure was snug and deemed adequate The serratus muscle was reapproximated with figure of 8 0 Vicryl The latissimus was reapproximated with a two 1 Vicryl placed in running fashion Of note two 10 JP drains were placed over the mesh repair of the chest wall The subcutaneous tissues were closed with a running 3 0 Vicryl suture and the skin was closed with a 4 0 Monocryl The wounds were dressed The patient was brought from the operating room directly to the North ICU intubated in stable condition All counts were correct"

a seizure and myoclonic jerks as well as hypoglycemia and anemia Regarding the seizure disorder Neurology was consulted Noncontrast CT of the head was negative Neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her Lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she was on 200 mg b i d Regarding the hypoglycemia the patient has diabetic gastroparesis and was being fed on J tube intermittent feedings throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour Her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings While in the hospital the insulin pump rate was turned down to 1 5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times She seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course There were a few episodes of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia but the episode seem to be related to the patient s n p o status and the changing rates of tube feedings throughout her hospital course At discharge her endocrinologist was contacted It was decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 units per hour from midnight till 6 a m from 0 8 units per hour from 6 a m until 8 a m and then at 0 2 units per hour from 8 a m until 6 p m The insulin was to be NovoLog Regarding the anemia the gastroenterologists were consulted regarding her positive Hemoccult stools A colonoscopy was performed which found a mass at the right hepatic flexure General Surgery was then consulted and a right hemicolectomy was performed on the patient The patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feeds were slowly restarted following the procedure and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rates of 120 per hour Regarding the cancer itself it was found that 1 out of 53 nodes were positive for cancer CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis a CT of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis Later in hospital course the patient developed a septic like picture likely secondary to hospital acquired pneumonia She was treated with Zosyn Levaquin and vancomycin and tolerated the medications well Her symptoms decreased and serial chest x rays were followed which showed some resolution of the illness The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease specialist The Infectious Disease specialist recommended vancomycin to cover MRSA

"Health1500","PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1 Nonfunctioning inflatable penile prosthesis 2 Peyronie s disease POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1 Nonfunctioning inflatable penile prosthesis 2 Peyronie s disease PROCEDURE PERFORMED Ex plantation of inflatable penile prosthesis and then placement of second inflatable penile prosthesis AMS700 ANESTHESIA General LMA SPECIMEN Old triple component inflatable penile prosthesis PROCEDURE This is a 64 year old male with prior history of Peyronie s disease and prior placement of a triple component inflatable penile prosthesis which had worked for years for him but has stopped working and subsequently has opted for ex plantation and replacement of inflatable penile prosthesis OPERATIVE PROCEDURE After informed consent the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position General endotracheal intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Department and the perineum scrotum penis and lower abdomen from the umbilicus down was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion in a 15 minute prep including iodine solution in the urethra The bladder was subsequently drained with a red Robinson catheter At that point the patient was then draped in a sterile fashion and an infraumbilical midline incision was made and taken down through the subcutaneous space Care was maintained to avoid all bleeding as possible secondary to the fact that we could not use Bovie cautery secondary to the patient s pacemaker and monopolar was only source of hemostasis besides suture At that point we got down to the fascia and the dorsal venous complex was easily identified as were both corporal bodies Attention was taken then to the tubing going up to the reservoir in the right lower quadrant This was dissected out bluntly and sharply with Metzenbaum scissors and monopolar used for hemostasis At this point as we tracked this proximally to the area of the rectus muscle we found that the tubing was violated and this was likely the source of his malfunctioned inflatable penile prosthesis As we tried to remove the tubing and get to the reservoir the tubing in fact completely broke as due to wire inside the tubing and the reservoir was left in its place secondary to risk of going after it and bleeding without the use of cautery At that point this tubing was then tracked down to the pump which was fairly easily removed from the dartos pouch in the right scrotum This was brought up into incision and the two tubings going towards the two cylinders were subsequently tracked first starting on the right side where a corporotomy incision was made at the placement of two 3 0 Prolene stay ties staying lateral and anterior on the corporal body The corporal body was opened up and the cylinder was removed from the right side without difficulty However we did have significant difficulty separating the tube connecting the pump to the right cylinder since this was surrounded by dense connective tissue and without the use of Bovie cautery this was very difficult and was very time consuming but we were able to do this and attention was then taken to the left side where the left proximal corporotomy was made after placement of two stick tie stay sutures This was done anterior and lateral staying away from the neurovascular bundle in the midline and this was done proximally on the corporal body The left cylinder was then subsequently explanted and this was very difficult as well trying to tract the tubing from the left cylinder across the midline back to the right pump since this was also densely scarred in and a small amount of bleeding which was controlled with monopolar and cautery was used on three different occasions but just simple small burst under the guidance of anesthesia and there was no ectopy noted After removal of half of the pump all the tubing and both cylinders these were passed off the table as specimen Both corporal bodies were then dilated with the Pratt dilators These were already fairly well dilated secondary to explantation of our cylinders and antibiotic irrigation was copiously used at this point and irrigated out both of our corporal spaces At this point using the Farlow device corporal bodies were measured first proximally then distally and they both measured out to be 9 cm proximally and 12 cm distally He had an 18 cm with rear tips in place which were removed We decided to go ahead to and use another 18 cm inflatable penile prosthesis Confident with our size we then placed rear tips originally 3 cm rear tips however we had difficulty placing the rear tips into the left crest We felt that this was just a little bit too long and replaced both rear tips and down sized from 2 cm to 1 cm At this point we went ahead and placed the right cylinder using the Farlow device and the Keith needle which was brought out through the glans penis and hemostated and the posterior rear tip was subsequently placed proximally entered the crest without difficulty Attention was then taken to the left side with the same thing was carried out however we did happen to dilate on two separate occasions both proximally and distally secondary to a very snug fit as well as buckling of the cylinders This then forced us to down size to the 1 cm rear tips which slipping very easily with the Farlow device through the glans penis There was no crossover and no violation of the tunica albuginea The rear tips were then placed without difficulty and our corporotomies were closed with 2 0 PDS in a running fashion starting on the patient s right side and then on the left side without difficulty and care was maintained to avoid damage or needle injury to the implants At that point the wound was copiously irrigated and the device was inflated multiple times There was a very good fit and we had a very good result At that point the pump was subsequently placed in the dartos pouch which already has been created and was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution This was held in place with a Babcock as well not to migrate proximally and attention was then taken to our connection from the reservoir to the pump Please also note that before placement of our pump attention was then taken up to the left lower quadrant where an incision was then made in external oblique aponeurosis approximately 3 cm dissection down underneath the rectus space was developed for our reservoir device which was subsequently placed without difficulty and three simple interrupted sutures of 2 0 Vicryl used to close the defect in the rectus and at that point after placement of our pump the connection was made between the pump and the reservoir without difficulty The entire system pump and corporal bodies were subsequently flushed and all air bubbles were evacuated After completion of the connection using a straight connector the prosthesis was inflated and we had very good results with air inflation with good erection in both cylinders with a very slight deviation to the left but this was able to be with good cosmetic result At that point after irrigation again of the space the area was simply dry and hemostatic The soft tissue was reapproximated to separate the cylinder so as not to lie in rope against one another and the wound was closed in multiple layers The soft tissue and the skin was then reapproximated with staples Please also note that prior to the skin closure a Jackson Pratt drain was subsequently placed through the left skin and left lower quadrant and subsequently placed just over tubings would be left in place for approximately 12 to 20 hours This was also sutured in place with nylon Sterile dressing was applied Light gauze was wrapped around the penis and or sutures that begin at the tip of the glans penis were subsequently cut and removed in entirety bilaterally Coban was used then to wrap the penis and at the end of the case the patient was straight catheted approximately 400 cc of amber yellow urine No Foley catheter was used or placed The patient was awoken in the operative suite extubated and transferred to recovery room in stable condition He will be admitted overnight to the service of Dr McDevitt Cardiology will be asked to consult with Dr Stomel for a pacer placement and he will be placed on the Telemetry floor and kept on IV antibiotics"

"Health1550","PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND INDICATIONS Acute non ST elevation MI POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND SUMMARY The patient presented with an acute non ST elevation MI Despite medical therapy she continued to have intermittent angina Angiography demonstrated the severe LAD as the culprit lesion This was treated as noted above with angioplasty alone as the stent could not be safely advanced She has residual lesions of 75 in the proximal right coronary and 60 proximal circumflex and the other residual LAD lesions as noted above She will be continued on her medical therapy At age 90 she is not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting PROCEDURE PERFORMED Selective coronary angiography coronary angioplasty PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After informed consent was obtained the patient was taken to the cath lab placed on the table in the supine position The area of the right femoral artery was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion Using the percutaneous technique a 6 French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance With the guidewire in place a 5 French JL 4 catheter was used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system The catheter was removed The sheath flushed The 5 French 3DRC catheter was then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery The cath removed the sheath flushed It was decided that intervention was needed in the severe lesions in the LAD which appeared to be the culprit lesions for the non ST elevation MI The patient was given a bolus of heparin and an ACT of approximately 50 seconds was obtained we rebolused and the ACT was slightly lower We repeated the level and it was slightly higher We administered 500 more units of heparin and then proceeded with an ACT of approximately 270 seconds prior to the 500 units of heparin IV Additionally the patient had been given 300 mg of Plavix orally during the procedure and Integrilin IV bolus and then maintenance drip was started A 6 French CLS 3 5 left coronary guide catheter was used to cannulate the left main and HEW guidewire was positioned in the distal LAD and another HEW guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal An Apex 2 5 x 15 mm balloon was positioned in the distal portion of the mid LAD stenosis and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated Angiography was then performed demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image was used for sizing the last of the needed stent The balloon was pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmospheres for approximately 20 seconds with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so as to not compromise the ostium The balloon was inflated and removed repeat angiography performed We attempted to advance a Driver 2 5 x 24 mm bare metal stent but I could not advance it beyond the proximal LAD where there was significant calcification The stent was removed Attempts to advance the same 2 5 x 15 mm Apex balloon that was previously used were unsuccessful It was removed a new Apex 2 5 x 15 mm balloon was then positioned in the proximal LAD and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it was inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and removed Repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection One more attempt was made to advance the Driver 2 5 x 24 mm bare metal stent but again I could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal LAD and this was despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal I felt that further attempts in this calcified vessel in a 90 year old with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complications of dissection so the stent was removed The guidewires and guide cath were removed The sheath flushed and sutured into position The patient moved to ICU in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all CONTRAST Isovue 370 120 mL FLUORO TIME 9 4 minutes ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS 30 mL HEMODYNAMICS Aorta 185 54 Left ventriculography was not performed I did not make an attempt to cross this severely stenotic aortic valve The left main is a large vessel giving rise to LAD and circumflex vessels The left main has no significant disease other than calcification in the walls The LAD is a moderate to large vessel giving rise to small diagonals and then a moderate to large third diagonal and then a small fourth diagonal The LAD has significant calcification proximally There is a 50 stenosis between the first and second diagonals that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent This resulted in a 30 residual mostly eccentric calcified plaque Following this there was a 50 stenosis in the LAD just after the takeoff of the third diagonal This was not ballooned Beyond this is an 80 stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then a 99 stenosis after the fourth diagonal These 2 lesions were dilated with 10 residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25 residual distal to the fourth diagonal As noted above this area was not stented because I could not safely advance the stent Note there was also a 50 stenosis at the origin of the moderate to large third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty The circumflex is a large nondominant vessel consisting of a large obtuse marginal with multiple branches The proximal circumflex has an eccentric 60 stenosis prior to the takeoff of the obtuse marginal The remainder of the vessel was without significant disease The right coronary was a large dominant vessel giving rise to a large posterior descending artery and small to moderate first posterolateral small second posterolateral and a small to moderate third posterolateral branch The right coronary has an eccentric smooth 75 stenosis beginning about a centimeter after the origin of the vessel and prior to the acute marginal branch The remainder of the right coronary and its branches were without significant disease"

concise but pressured His attitude was overly negative and his mood was significant for moderate depression anxiety anhedonia and loneliness and mild evidence of anger There was no evidence of euphoria or diurnal mood variation His affective expression was restricted range but there was no evidence of lability At times his affective tone and facial expressions were inappropriate to the

the patient s self report and objective testing and observation His attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder IMPRESSIONS Major Depressive Disorder single episode RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN I recommend Mr T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy At this time the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr T from seeking employment Furthermore it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25 2003 when Mr T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year As Mr T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning Furthermore it only appears logical that this would precipitate a major depressive episode"

endotracheal SPECIMEN None DRAIN None COMPLICATIONS None The patient tolerated the procedure without any complication PROCEDURE IN DETAIL The patient was brought to the operating room prepped and draped in sterile fashion After adequate anesthesia was achieved a curvilinear incision was made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 1 5 cm medial of the ASIS down to the suprapubic space After this was taken down with a 10 blade electrocautery was used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat Camper s and Scarpa s were dissected with electrocautery Hemostasis was achieved throughout the tissue plains with electrocautery The external oblique aponeurosis was identified with musculature and was entered with electrocautery Then hemostats were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal obliques and the transversalis fascia Additionally the rectus sheath was entered in a linear fashion After these planes were entered using electrocautery the retroperitoneum was dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection After the peritoneum and peritoneal structures were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue planes removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery Upon entering through the transversalis fascia the epigastric vessels were identified and doubly ligated and tied with 0 silk ties After the ligation of the epigastric vessels the peritoneum was bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structures were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane This was done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly The round ligament was identified and doubly ligated at this time with 0 silk ties as well The dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery This alveolar tissue was cleared using blunt dissection as well as electrocautery After the external iliac artery was identified it was cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture The right iliac vein was then identified and this was cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection After the right iliac vein was identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue it was circumferentially cleared as well An additional perforating branch was noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein This was tied with a 0 silk tie and secured Hemostasis was achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control The dissection continued down and identified all other vital structures in this area Careful preservation of all vital structures was carried out throughout the dissection At this time Satinsky clamp was placed over the right iliac vein This was then opened using a 11 blade approximately 1 cm in length The heparinized saline was placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein and the kidney was pulled into the abdominal field still covered in its protective socking with the superior pole marked The renal vein was then elevated and identified in this area A 5 0 double ended Prolene stitch was used to secure the renal vein both superiorly and inferiorly and after appropriately being secured with 5 0 Prolene these were tied down and secured The renal vein was then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior poles The dissection then continued down and the iliac artery was then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 5 0 Prolene securing both superior and inferior poles After such time the 5 0 Prolene was run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again After this was done and the artery was secured the Satinsky clamp was removed and a bulldog placed over The flow was then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow The bulldog was then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney The kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow At this time all Satinsky clamps were removed and all bulldog clamps were removed The dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder was identified Appropriate area on the dome the bladder was identified for entry This was entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the Metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion Before this was done 0 chromic catgut stitches were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder was entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length At this time a renal stent was placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent was then placed into the bladder and secured as well Subsequently the superior and inferior pole stitches with 5 0 Prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder This was then run mucosa to mucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again Good flow was noted from the ureter at the time of operation Additional Vicryl stitches were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself At this time an Ethibond stitch was used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again This was inspected and noted for proper control Irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder was appropriately filled and there were no flows and no defects At this time the anastomoses were all inspected hemostasis was achieved and good closure of the anastomosis was noted at this time The kidney was then placed back into its new position in the right pelvic fossa and the area was once again inspected for hemostasis which was achieved A 1 0 Prolene stitch was then used for mass closure of the external internal and transversalis fascias and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior This was secured and knots were dumped Subsequently the area was then checked and inspected for hemostasis which was achieved with electrocautery and the skin was closed with 4 0 running Monocryl The patient tolerated procedure well without evidence of complication transferred to the Dunn ICU where he was noted to be stable Dr A was present and scrubbed through the entire procedure"

"Health1680","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is an 84 year old woman with a history of hypertension severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension mild aortic stenosis and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and I was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after a fall Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances on her driveway and on her left side hit a rock When she came to the emergency room she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s so that was stopped Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs Her potassium at that time was 3 1 She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems PAST CARDIAC HISTORY She is followed by Dr X in our office and has a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild elevation and PA pressure On 05 12 08 preserved left and right ventricular systolic function aortic sclerosis with apparent mild aortic stenosis and bi atrial enlargement She has previously had a Persantine Myoview nuclear rest stress test scan completed at ABCD Medical Center in 07 06 that was negative She has had significant mitral valve regurgitation in the past being moderate but on the most recent echocardiogram on 05 12 08 that was not felt to be significant She has a history of hypertension and EKGs in our office show normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs versus wandering atrial pacemaker She does have a history of significant hypertension in the past She has had dizzy spells and denies clearly any true syncope She has had bradycardia in the past from beta blocker therapy MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION 1 Multivitamin p o daily 2 Aspirin 325 mg once a day 3 Lisinopril 40 mg once a day 4 Felodipine 10 mg once a day 5 Klor Con 20 mEq p o b i d 6 Omeprazole 20 mg p o daily presumably for GERD 7 MiraLax 17 g p o daily 8 Lasix 20 mg p o daily ALLERGIES PENICILLIN IT IS LISTED THAT TOPROL HAS CAUSED SHORTNESS OF BREATH IN HER OFFICE CHART AND I BELIEVE SHE HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT BRADYCARDIA WITH THAT IN THE PAST FAMILY HISTORY She states her brother died of an MI suddenly in his 50s SOCIAL HISTORY She does not smoke cigarettes abuse alcohol nor use any illicit drugs She is retired from Morse Chain and delivering newspapers She is widowed She lives alone but has family members who live either on her property or adjacent to it REVIEW OF SYSTEMS She denies a history of stroke cancer vomiting of blood coughing up blood bright red blood per rectum bleeding stomach ulcers She does not recall renal calculi nor cholelithiasis denies asthma emphysema pneumonia tuberculosis sleep apnea home oxygen use She does note occasional peripheral edema She is not aware of prior history of MI She denies diabetes She does have a history of GERD She notes feeling depressed at times because of living alone She denies rheumatologic conditions including psoriasis or lupus Remainder of review of systems is negative times 15 except as described above PHYSICAL EXAM Height 5 feet 0 inches weight 123 pounds temperature 99 2 degrees Fahrenheit blood pressure has ranged from 160 87 with pulses recorded at being 144 and currently ranges 101 53 to 147 71 pulse 64 respiratory rate 20 O2 saturation 97 On general exam she is a pleasant elderly woman who is hard of hearing but is alert and interactive HEENT Shows cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic She has moist mucosal membranes Neck veins were not distended There are no carotid bruits Lungs Clear to auscultation anteriorly without wheezes She is relatively immobile because of her left hip fracture Cardiac Exam S1 S2 regular rate frequent ectopic beats 2 6 systolic ejection murmur preserved aortic component of the second heart sound There is also a soft holosystolic murmur heard There is no rub or gallop PMI is nondisplaced Abdomen is soft and nondistended Bowel sounds present Extremities without significant clubbing cyanosis and there is trivial to 1 peripheral edema Pulses appear grossly intact Affect is appropriate Visible skin warm and perfused She is not able to move because of left hip fracture easily in bed DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES LAB DATA Pertinent labs include chest x ray with radiology report pending but shows only a calcified aortic knob No clear pulmonary vascular congestion Sodium 140 potassium 3 7 it was 3 1 on admission chloride 106 bicarbonate 27 BUN 17 creatinine 0 9 glucose 150 magnesium was 2 on 07

beats per minute no ischemic changes She had a followup EKG done at 20 37 on 08 19 08 which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T wave changes not significantly changed from prior Followup EKG done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs IMPRESSION She is an 84 year old female with a history of hypertension severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery Telemetry now reviewed shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia which has been corrected There has been no atrial fibrillation documented I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil which has been started which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia which she had and would watch for heart rate with that Continued optimization of electrolytes The patient cannot take beta blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath although there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil The patient is aware of the cardiac risks certainly it is moderate and wishes to proceed with needed surgery I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr X after discharge Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist"

Laparoscopy 3 Right salpingectomy 4 Lysis of adhesions 5 Evacuation of hemoperitoneum ANESTHESIA General endotracheal ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Scant from the operation however there was approximately 2 liters of clotted and old blood in the abdomen SPECIMENS Endometrial curettings and right fallopian tube COMPLICATIONS None FINDINGS On bimanual exam the patient has a small anteverted uterus it is freely mobile No adnexal masses however were appreciated on the bimanual exam Laparoscopically the patient had numerous omental adhesions to the vesicouterine peritoneum in the fundus of the uterus There were also adhesions to the left fallopian tube and the right fallopian tube There was a copious amount of blood in the abdomen approximately 2 liters of clotted and unclotted blood There was some questionable gestational tissue on the left sacrospinous ligament There was an apparent rupture and bleeding ectopic pregnancy in the isthmus portion of the right fallopian tube PROCEDURE After an informed consent was obtained the patient was taken to the operating room and the general anesthetic was administered She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion Once the anesthetic was found to be adequate a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic A weighted speculum was then placed in the vagina The interior wall of vagina elevated with the uterine sound and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum The cervix was then serially dilated with Hank dilators to a size 20 Hank and then a sharp curettage was performed obtaining a moderate amount of decidual appearing tissue and the tissue was then sent to pathology At this point the uterine manipulator was placed in the cervix and attached to the anterior cervix and vulsellum tenaculum and weighted speculum were removed Next attention was then turned to the abdomen The surgeons all are removed the dirty gloves in the previous portion of the case Next a 2 cm incision was made immediately inferior to umbilicus The superior aspect of the umbilicus was grasped with a towel clamp and a Veress needle was inserted through this incision Next a syringe was used to inject normal saline into the Veress needle The normal saline was seen to drop freely so a Veress needle was connected to the CO2 gas which was started at its lowest setting The gas was seen to flow freely with normal resistance so the CO2 gas was advanced to a higher setting The abdomen was insufflated to an adequate distension Once an adequate distention was reached the CO2 gas was disconnected The Veress needle was removed and a size 11 step trocar was placed The introducer was removed and the trocar was connected to the CO2 gas and a camera was inserted Next a 1 cm incision was made in the midline approximately two fingerbreadths below the pubic symphysis after transilluminating with the camera A Veress needle and a step sheath were inserted through this incision Next the Veress needle was removed and a size 5 trocar was inserted under direct visualization Next a size 5 port was placed approximately five fingerbreadths to the left of the umbilicus in a similar fashion A size 12 port was placed in a similar fashion approximately six fingerbreadths to the right of the umbilicus and also under direct visualization The laparoscopic dissector was inserted through the suprapubic port and this was used to dissect the omental adhesions bluntly from the vesicouterine peritoneum and the bilateral fallopian tubes Next the Dorsey suction irrigator was used to copiously irrigate the abdomen Approximate total of 3 liters of irrigation was used and the majority of all blood clots and free blood was removed from the abdomen Once the majority of blood was cleaned from the abdomen the ectopic pregnancy was easily identified and the end of the fallopian tube was grasped with the grasper from the left upper quadrant and the LigaSure device was then inserted through the right upper quadrant with 12 port Three bites with the LigaSure device were used to transect the mesosalpinx inferior to the fallopian tube and then transect the fallopian tube proximal to the ectopic pregnancy An EndoCatch bag was then placed to the size 12 port and this was used to remove the right fallopian tube and ectopic pregnancy This was then sent to the pathology Next the right mesosalpinx and remains of the fallopian tube were examined again and they were seemed to be hemostatic The abdomen was further irrigated The liver was examined and appeared to be within normal limits At this point the two size 5 ports and a size 12 port were removed under direct visualization The camera was then removed The CO2 gas was disconnected and the abdomen was desufflated The introducer was then replaced in a size 11 port and the whole port and introducer was removed as a single unit All laparoscopic incisions were closed with a 4 0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular interrupted fashion They were then steri stripped and bandaged appropriately At the end of the procedure the uterine manipulator was removed from the cervix and the patient was taken to

holding area after keeping herself n p o since mid night for surgery on her painful bunion to her right foot and her painful hammertoes to both feet The patient has a history of sharp pain which is aggravated by wearing shoes and ambulation She has tried multiple conservative methods and treatment such as wide shoes and accommodative padding all of which provided inadequate relief At this time she desires attempted surgical correction The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed in detail by Dr Kaczander with the patient and the consent is available on the chart PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety strap placed across her waist for her protection Copious amounts of Webril were applied about both ankles and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril After adequate IV sedation was administered a total of 18 cc of a 0 5 Marcaine plain was used to anesthetize the right foot performing a Mayo block and a bilateral third fourth and fifth digital block Next the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion bilaterally The foot was elevated off the table and an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right foot The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated on the right foot to 200 mmHg The foot was lowered into operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected proximally Attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint it was found to be contracted and there was lateral deviation of the hallux There was decreased range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint A dorsolinear incision was made with a 10 blade approximately 4 cm in length The incision was deepened to the subcutaneous layer with a 15 blade Any small veins traversing the subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery Next the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined sharply Care was taken to avoid the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon Next the first metatarsal joint capsule was identified A 15 blade was used to make a linear capsular incision down to the bone The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a 15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound The PASA was found to be within normal limits There was a hypertrophic medial eminence noted A sagittal saw was used to remove the hypertrophic medial eminence A 0 045 inch Kirschner wire was placed into the central medial aspect of the metatarsal head as an access guide A standard lateral release was performed The fibular sesamoid was found to be in the interspace but was relocated onto the metatarsal head properly Next a sagittal saw was used to perform a long arm Austin osteotomy The K wire was removed The capital fragment was shifted laterally and impacted into the head A 0 045 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the osteotomy A 2 7 x 16 mm Synthes fully threaded cortical screw was throne using standard AO technique A second screw was throne which was a 2 0 x 12 mm Synthes cortical screw Excellent fixation was achieved and the screws tightly perched the bone Next the medial overhanging wedge was removed with a sagittal saw A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences The 0 045 inch Kirschner wire was removed The screws were checked again for tightness and found to be very tight The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline A 3 0 Vicryl was used to close the capsular periosteal tissues with simple interrupted suture technique A 4 0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted technique A 5 0 Monocryl was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion Attention was directed to the right third digit which was found to be markedly contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint A 15 blade was used to make two convergent semi elliptical incisions over the distal interphalangeal joint The incision was deepened with a 15 blade The wedge of skin was removed in full thickness The long extensor tendon was identified and the distal and proximal borders of the wound were undermined The 15 blade was used to transect the long extensor tendon which was reflected proximally The distal interphalangeal joint was identified and the 15 blade was placed in the joint and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released Crown and collar scissors were used to release the planar attachment to the head of the middle phalanx Next a double action bone cutter was used to resect the head of the middle phalanx The toe was dorsiflexed and was found to have an excellent rectus position A hand rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline The flexor tendon was found to be contracted therefore a flexor tenotomy was performed through the dorsal incision Next 3 0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures A 4 0 nylon was used to close the skin and excellent cosmetic result was achieved Attention was directed to the fourth toe which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint and abducted and varus rotated An oblique skin incision with two converging semi elliptical incisions was created using 15 blade The rest of the procedure was repeated exactly the same as the above paragraph to the third toe on the right foot All the same suture materials were used However there was no flexor tenotomy performed on this toe only on the third toe bilaterally Attention was directed to the fifth right digit which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint A linear incision approximately 2 cm in length was made with a 15 blade over the proximal interphalangeal joint Next a 15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer The medial and lateral margins were undermined sharply to the level of the long extensor tendon The proximal interphalangeal joint was identified and the tendon was transected with the 15 blade The tendon was reflected proximally off the head of the proximal phalanx The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound A double action bone nibbler was used to remove the head of the proximal phalanx A hand rasp was used to smooth residual bone The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline A 3 0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures A 4 0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures A standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline soaked 0 1 silk 4 x 4s Kerlix Kling and Coban were applied The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits Attention was directed to the left foot The foot was elevated off the table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 200 mmHg Attention was directed to the left fifth toe which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint The exact same procedure performed to the right fifth digit was performed on this toe with the same materials being used for suture and closure Attention was then directed to the left fourth digit which was found to contracted and slightly abducted and varus rotated The exact same procedure as performed to the right fourth toe was performed consisting of two semi elliptical skin incisions in an oblique angle The same suture material were used to close the incision Attention was directed to the left third digit which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint The same procedure performed on the right third digit was also performed The same suture materials were used to close the wound and the flexor tenotomy was also performed at this digit A standard postoperative dressing was also applied to the left foot consisting of the same materials as described for the right foot The pneumatic tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications She was transported via cart to

gentleman here with his wife She confirms the history of loud snoring at night with witnessed apnea The result of the sleep study was reviewed This showed moderate sleep apnea with significant desaturation The patient was unable to tolerate treatment with CPAP At the office we observed large tonsils and elongation and thickening of the uvula as well as redundant soft tissue of the palate A tortuous appearance of the septum also was observed This morning I talked to the patient and his wife about the findings I reviewed the CT images He has no history of sinus infections and does not recall a history of nasal trauma We discussed the removal of tonsils and uvula and soft palate tissue and the hope that this would help with his airway Depending on the findings of surgery I explained that I might remove that bone spur that we are seeing within the nasal passage I will get the best look at it when he is asleep We discussed recovery as well He visited with Dr XYZ about the anesthetic produce PROCEDURE General tracheal anesthetic was administered by Dr XYZ and Mr Radke Afrin drops were placed in both nostrils and a cottonoid soaked with Afrin was placed in each side of the nose A Crowe Davis mouth gag was placed The tonsils were very large and touched the uvula The uvula was relatively long and very thick and there were redundant folds of soft palate mucosa and prominent posterior and anterior tonsillar pillars Also there was a cryptic appearance of the tonsils but there was no acute redness or exudate Retraction of the soft palate permitted evaluation of the nasopharynx with the mirror and the choanae were patent and there was no adenoid tissue present A very crowded pharynx was appreciated The tonsils were first removed using electrodissection technique Hemostasis was achieved with the electrocautery and with sutures of 0 plain catgut The tonsil fossae were injected with 0 25 Marcaine with 1 200 000 epinephrine There already was more room in the pharynx but the posterior pharyngeal wall was still obscured by the soft palate and uvula The uvula was grasped with the Alice clamp I palpated the posterior edge of the hard palate and calculated removal of about a third of the length of the soft palate We switched over from the Bayonet cautery to the blunt needle tip electrocautery The planned anterior soft palate incision was marked out with the electrocautery from the left anterior tonsillar pillar rising upwards and then extending horizontally across the soft palate to include all of the uvula and a portion of the soft palate and the incision then extended across the midline and then inferiorly to meet the right anterior tonsillar pillar This incision was then deepened with the electrocautery on a cutting current The uvular artery just to the right of the midline was controlled with the suction electrocautery The posterior soft palate incision was made parallel to the anterior soft palate incision but was made leaving a longer length of mucosa to permit closure of the palatoplasty A portion of the redundant soft palate mucosa tissue also was included with the resection specimen and the tissue including the soft palate and uvula was included with the surgical specimen as the tonsils were sent to pathology The tonsil fossae were injected with 0 25 Marcaine with 1 200 000 epinephrine The soft palate was also injected with 0 25 Marcaine with 1 200 000 epinephrine The posterior tonsillar pillars were then brought forward to close to the anterior tonsillar pillars and these were sutured down to the tonsil bed with interrupted 0 plain catgut sutures The posterior soft palate mucosa was advanced forward and brought up to the anterior soft palate incision and closure of the soft palate wound was then accomplished with interrupted 3 0 chromic catgut sutures A much improved appearance of the oropharynx with a greatly improved airway was appreciated A moist tonsil sponge was placed into the nasopharynx and the mouth gag was removed I removed the cottonoids from both nostrils Speculum exam showed the inferior turbinates were large the septum was tortuous and it angulated to the right and then sharply bent back to the left The septum was injected with 0 25 Marcaine with 1 200 000 epinephrine using a separate syringe and needle A 15 blade was used to make a left cheilion incision Mucoperichondrium and mucoperiosteum were elevated with the Cottle elevator When we reached the deflected portion of the vomer this was separated from the septal cartilage with a Freer elevator The right sided mucoperiosteum was elevated with the Freer elevator and then with Takahashi forceps and with the 4 mm osteotome the deflected portion of the septal bone from the vomer was resected This tissue also was sent as a separate specimen to pathology The intraseptal space was irrigated with saline and suctioned The nasal septal mucosal flaps were then sutured together with a quilting suture of 4 0 plain catgut I observed no evidence of purulent secretion or polyp formation within the nostrils The inferior turbinates were then both outfractured using a knife handle and now there was a much more patent nasal airway on both sides There was good support for the nasal tip and the dorsum and there was good hemostasis within the nose No packing was used in the nostrils Polysporin ointment was introduced into both nostrils The mouth gag was reintroduced and the pack removed from the nasopharynx The nose and throat were irrigated with saline and suctioned An orogastric tube was placed and a moderate amount of clear fluid suctioned from the stomach and this tube was removed Sponge and needle count were reported correct The mouth gag having been withdrawn the patient was then awakened and returned to recovery room in a satisfactory condition He tolerated the operation excellently Estimated blood loss was about 15 20 cc In the recovery room I observed that he was moving air well and I spoke with his wife about the findings of surgery"

who was evaluated for an independent medical examination on September 20 2007 because of an injury sustained to the left leg The injured worker does state that he was working as a processor for the ABCD Company on July 18 2007 when he injured his left knee He does state he was working in a catwalk when he stepped up He noticed his sight glass was not open on the tank He then stepped straight down and his knee went sideways His knee popped and he sat down secondary to discomfort At that time he could not do any type of activity secondary to the pain The nurse called the ambulance subsequent to this injury and he was taken to Bethesda North X rays were obtained which demonstrated no evidence of fracture Thereafter he was referred to X who he saw on July 19 2007 It was felt that a MRI scan about the knee needed to be obtained and it was obtained on July 24 It was noted that there was evidence of an anterior cruciate ligament tear and a slight medial meniscal tear On his second visit it was felt that arthroscopic surgery intervention was indicated as related to the left knee On September 7 2007 he underwent surgical intervention at ABC for the anterior cruciate reconstruction as well as the partial medial meniscectomy At the present time he is progressing along with physical therapy He is utilizing one crutch He does admit to significant bruising and swelling about the left lower extremity If he does indeed move too fast the discomfort is increased His pain about the left knee is approximately 6 to 7 on a scale of 1 to 10 He has had injuries to the right knee in which he wrecked his bicycle and did have some type of fracture bone spur when he was 13 years of age He underwent arthroscopic surgery as related to the right knee at that time and really did quite well His next appointment with Dr X is on October 4 2007 The injured worker denies any previous history of similar problems as related to the left knee MEDICATIONS Glucophage Lipitor Actos Benicar glimepiride and Januvia SURGICAL HISTORY Arthroscopic surgery of the left knee and arthroscopic surgery of the right knee SOCIAL HISTORY The patient denies alcohol consumption He does smoke approximately one and a half packs of cigarettes per day His education is that of 12th grade PHYSICAL EXAMINATION This is a healthy appearing 34 year old male who is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 285 pounds He does not appear to be in distress at this time Examination is limited to the left knee One could appreciate a healed scar as related to the inferior pole inferior to the patella There are healed arthroscopic scars as well The range of motion of left knee reveals 50 to 70 degrees of flexion There is evidence of medial and lateral joint line discomfort Anterior Lachman s test was negative No evidence of atrophy is noted There is weakness with aggressive function about the quadriceps and hamstring musculature The patient is ambulating with one crutch at this time There is mild degree of swelling as related to the left knee Deep tendon reflexes are 2 2 bilaterally symmetrical Sensory examination was normal as related to the foot but abnormal as related to the left knee I did review pictures that were taken at the time of the surgery which demonstrates the meniscectomy and the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction MEDICAL RECORDS REVIEW 1 July 18 2007 x rays of the left knee demonstrated evidence of a small suprapatellar joint effusion It should be noted that the exam demonstrated evidence of medial and lateral joint line discomfort There was specific mention of intraarticular effusion 2 On July 27 2007 MRI scan of the left knee was obtained which demonstrated evidence of the complete tear of the mid to distal ACL Findings suggestive of a chronic injury Grade I sprain of the MCL was noted Contusion plateau medial femoral condyle and lateral femoral condyle was noted There was evidence of a small peripheral longitudinal tear of the posterior horn of medial meniscus Chondromalacia of the lateral femoral condyle and patella was noted It should be noted that the changes of degeneration of the cartilages of the injured worker s knee and the chronic anterior cruciate ligament changes were noted related to the July 18 2007 injury 3 July 18 2007 first report of injury occupational disease and or death 4 Evaluations of ABCD Hospital It should be noted that the mechanism of injury was such that he was walking down the stairs when his left knee locked up 5 July 18 2007 x rays of the left knee were obtained which demonstrated the evidence of no acute fracture or significant osteoarthritis There is evidence there maybe a small suprapatellar joint effusion 6 Notes from the office of Dr X It should be noted on physical examination his range of motion is 8 to 20 degrees 7 Physical therapy prescription for Orthopedics and Sports Medicine Corporation 8 August 10 2007 requests for arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon 9 Physician narrative of August 24 2007 It is noted that the injured worker did indeed have evidence of hypertension hyperlipidemia and diabetes His BMI was 42 This was felt pre injury MRI scan Following your review of the medical information and your physical examination please answer the following questions as these pertain to the allowed conditions Please express your opinion based upon a reasonable degree of medical probability QUESTION Mr XXXXXX has filed an application for the additional allowance of left knee tear of the medial meniscus and left knee ACL tear Based on the current objective findings mechanism of injury or and medical records or diagnosis studies does the medical evidence support the existence of any of the requested conditions ANSWER The MRI sustains and verifies that these conditions do indeed exist subsequent to the injury of July 18 2007 QUESTION If you find any of these conditions exist are they a direct and proximate result of the July 18 2007 injury ANSWER There is mention of degeneration as related to the knee prior to this episode This is not surprising considering the individual s weight There is no question degeneration as related to anterior cruciate ligament and the meniscus has been occurring for a lengthy period of time There has been an aggravation of this condition Without having a MRI to review prior to this injury I believe it would be safe to assume that there has been aggravation of a pre existing condition as related to the left knee and meniscal and anterior cruciate ligament pathology Thus there is definitely evidence of an aggravation of a pre existing condition but not necessarily a direct and proximate result of the July 18 2007 injury QUESTION"

INDICATIONS Mrs Smith is a 75 year old female who has had severe back pain that began approximately three months ago and is debilitating She has been unresponsive to nonoperative treatment modalities including bed rest and analgesics She presents with and is on medication therapy for COPD diabetes and hypertension other co morbidities may be present upon admission and should be documented in the operative note Radiographic imaging including MRI confirms multiple compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine including T12 L1 and L2 In addition to the fractures she presents with kyphotic posture Films on 1 04 demonstrated L1 and L2 osteoporotic fractures Films on 2 04 demonstrated increased loss of height at L1 Films on 3 04 demonstrated a new compression fracture at T12 and further collapse of L1 The L2 fracture is documented on radiographic studies as being chronic and a year or more old The T12 fracture has the most significant kyphotic deformity Based on these findings we have decided to perform KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty on the L1 and T12 fractures PROCEDURE The patient was brought to the operating room radiology suite and general anesthesia local sedation with endotracheal intubation was performed The patient was positioned prone on the Jackson table The back was prepped and draped The image intensifier C arm was brought into position and the T12 pedicles were identified and marked with a skin marker In view of the collapse of T12 a transpedicular approach to the vertebral body was appropriate An 11 gauge needle was advanced through the T12 pedicle to the junction of the pedicle and vertebral body on the right side Positioning was confirmed on the AP and lateral plane Following satisfactory placement of the needle the stylet was removed A guide pin was inserted through the 11g to a point 3mm from the anterior cortex AP and lateral images were taken to verify position and trajectory Alongside of the guide pin a 1 cm paramedian incision was made The needle was then removed leaving the guide pin in place The osteointroducer was placed over the guide pin and advanced through the pedicle Once I was at the junction of the pedicle and the vertebral body a lateral image was taken to insure that the cannula was positioned approximately 1cm past the vertebral body wall Through the cannula a drill was advanced into the vertebral body under fluoroscopic guidance toward the anterior cortex creating a channel The anterior cortex was probed with the guide pin to ensure no perforations in the anterior cortex After completing the entry into the vertebral body a 15 mm inflatable bone tamp was inserted through the cannula and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the vertebral body near the anterior cortex The radiopaque marker bands on the bone tamp were identified using AP and lateral images The above sequence of instrument placement was then repeated on the left side of the T12 vertebral body Once both bone tamps were in position they were inflated to 0 5 cc and 50 psi Expansion of the bone tamps was done sequentially in increments of 0 25 to 0 5 cc of contrast with careful attention being paid to the inflation pressures and balloon position The inflation was monitored with AP and lateral imaging The final balloon volume was 3 5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left There was no breach of the lateral wall or anterior cortex of the vertebral body Direct reduction of the fracture was achieved end plate movement was noted and approximately 5 mm of height restoration was achieved Under fluoroscopic imaging and the use of the bone void fillers internal fixation was achieved through a low pressure injection of KYPHON HV R bone cement The cavity was filled with a total volume of 3 5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left side Once the bone cement had hardened the cannulas were then removed At this time we proceeded to perform a balloon kyphoplasty at L1 using the same sequence of steps as on T12 An entry needle was placed bilaterally through the pedicle into the vertebral body a cortical window was created inflation of the bone tamps directly reduced the fracture the bone tamps were removed and internal fixation by bone void filler insertion was achieved Throughout the procedure AP and lateral imaging monitored positioning Post procedure all incisions were closed with sutures The patient was kept in the prone position for approximately 10 minutes post cement injection She was then turned supine monitored briefly and returned to the floor She was moving both her lower extremities at this time Throughout the procedure there were no intraoperative complications Estimated blood loss was minimal"

examination is intended for evaluative purposes only and that it is not intended to constitute a general medical examination It is explained to the examinee that the traditional doctor patient relationship does not apply to this examination and that a written report will be provided to the agency requesting this examination It has also been emphasized to the examinee that he should not attempt any physical activity beyond his tolerance in order to avoid injury CHIEF COMPLAINT Aching and mid back pain HISTORY OF PRESENT INJURY Based upon the examinee s perspective Mr Abc is a 52 year old self employed independent consultant for DEMILEE USA He is also a mechanical engineer He reports that he was injured in a motor vehicle accident that occurred in October 4 2000 At that time he was employed as a purchasing agent for IBIKEN USA On the date of the motor vehicle accident he was sitting in the right front passenger s seat wearing seat and shoulder belt safety harnesses in his 1996 or 1997 Volvo 850 Wagon automobile driven by his son The vehicle was completely stopped and was slammed from behind by a van The police officer who responded to the accident told Mr Abc that the van was probably traveling at approximately 30 miles per hour at the time of impact During the impact Mr Abc was restrained in the seat and did not contact the interior surface of the vehicle He experienced immediate mid back pain He states that the Volvo automobile sustained approximately 4600 in damage He was transported by an ambulance secured by a cervical collar and backboard to the emergency department An x ray of the whole spine was obtained and he was evaluated by a physician s assistant He was told that it would be okay to walk He was prescribed pain pills and told to return for reevaluation if he experienced increasing pain He returned to the Kaiser facility a few days later and physical therapy was prescribed Mr Abc states that he was told that these things can take a long time He indicates that after one year he was no better He then states that after two years he was no better and worried if the condition would never get better He indicates he saw an independent physician a general practitioner and an MRI was ordered The MRI study was completed at ABCD Hospital Subsequently Mr Abc returned and was evaluated by a physiatrist The physiatrist reexamined the original thoracic spine x rays that were taken on October 4 2000 and stated that he did not know why the radiologist did not originally observe vertebral compression fractures Mr Abc believes that he was told by the physiatrist that it involved either T6 T7 or T7 T8 Mr Abc reports that the physiatrist told him that little could be done besides participation in core strengthening Mr Abc describes his current exercise regimen consisting of cycling and it was deemed to be adequate He was told however by the physiatrist that he could also try a Pilates type of core exercise program The physiatrist ordered a bone scan and Mr Abc is unsure of the results He does not have a formal follow up scheduled with Kaiser and is awaiting re contact by the physiatrist He denies any previous history of symptomatology or injuries involving his back CURRENT SYMPTOMS He reports that he has the same mid back pain that has been present since the original injury It is located in the same area the mid thoracic spine area It is described as a pain and an ache and ranges from 3 10 to 6 10 in intensity and the intensity varies seeming to go in cycles The pain has been staying constant When I asked whether or not the pain have improved he stated that he was unable to determine whether or not he had experienced improvement He indicates that there may be less pain or conversely that he may have developed more of a tolerance for the pain He further states that I can power through it I have learned how to manage the pain using exercise stretching and diversion techniques It is primary limitation with regards to the back pain involves prolonged sitting After approximately two hours of sitting he has required to get up and move around which results in diminishment of the pain He indicates that prior to the motor vehicle accident he could sit for significantly longer periods of time 10 to 12 hours on a regular basis and up to 20 hours continuously on an occasional basis He has never experienced radiation of the pain from the mid thoracic spine and he has never experienced radicular symptoms of radiation of pain into the extremities numbness tingling or weakness Again aggravating activities include prolonged sitting greater than approximately two hours Alleviating activities include moving around stretching and exercising Also if he takes ibuprofen it does seem to help with the back pain He is not currently taking medications regularly but list that he takes occasional ibuprofen when the pain is too persistent He indicates that he received several physical therapy sessions for treatment and was instructed in stretching and exercises He has subsequently performed the prescribed stretching and exercises daily for nearly three years With regards to recreational activities he states that he has not limited his activities due to his back pain He denies bowel or bladder dysfunction FILES REVIEW October 4 2000 An ambulance was dispatched to the scene of a motor vehicle accident on South and Partlow Road The EMS crew arrived to find a 49 year old male sitting in the front passenger seat of a vehicle that was damaged in a rear end collision and appeared to have minimal damage He was wearing a seatbelt and he denied loss of consciousness He also denied a pertinent past medical history They noted pain in the lower cervical area mid thoracic and lumbar area They placed him on a backboard and transported him to Medical Center October 4 2000 He was seen in the emergency department of Medical Center The provider is described as

mid back pain He denied extremity weakness Sensory examination was intact There was no tenderness with palpation or flexion in the neck The back was a little tender in the upper thoracic spine area without visible deformity There were no marks on the back His x ray was described as no acute bony process Listed visit diagnosis was a sprain thoracic and he was prescribed hydrocodone acetaminophen tablets and Motrin 800 mg tablets October 4 2000 During the visit a Clinician s Report of Disability document was signed by Dr M authorizing time loss from October 4 2000 through October 8 2000 The document also advised no heavy lifting pushing pulling or overhead work for two weeks During this visit a thoracic spine x ray series two views was obtained and read by Dr JR The findings demonstrate no evidence of acute injury No notable arthritic findings The pedicles and paravertebral soft tissues appear unremarkable November 21 2000 An outpatient progress note was completed at Kaiser and the clinician of record was Dr H The history obtained documents that Mr Abc continued to experience the same pain that he first noted after the accident described as a discomfort in the mid thoracic spine area It was non radiating and described as a tightness He also reported that he was hearing clicking noises that he had not previously heard He denied loss of strength in the arms The physical examination revealed good strength and normal deep tendon reflexes in the arms There was minimal tenderness over T4 through T8 in an approximate area The visit diagnosis listed was back pain Also described in the assessment was residual pain from MVA suspected bruised muscles He was prescribed Motrin 800 mg tablets and an order was sent to physical therapy Dr N also documents that if the prescribed treatment measures were not effective then he would suggest a referral to a physiatrist Also the doctor wanted him to discuss with physical therapy whether or not they thought that a chiropractor would be beneficial December 4 2000 He was seen at Kaiser for a physical therapy visit by Philippe Justel physical therapist The history obtained from Mr Abc is that he was not improving Symptoms described were located in the mid back centrally The examination revealed mild tenderness centrally at T3 T8 with very poor segmental mobility The posture was described as rigid T S in flexion Range of motion was described as within normal limits without pain at the cervical spine and thoracic spine The plan listed included two visits per week for two weeks for mobilization It is also noted that the physical therapist would contact the MD regarding a referral to a chiropractor December 8 2000 He was seen at Kaiser for a physical therapy visit by Mr Justel It was noted that the subjective category of the document revealed that there was no real change It was noted that Mr Abc tolerated the treatment well and that he was to see a chiropractor on Monday December 11 2000 He presented to the Chiropractic Wellness Center There is a form titled Chiropractic Case History and it documents that Mr Abc was involved in a motor vehicle accident in which he was rear ended in October He has had mid back pain since that time The pain is worsened with sitting especially at a computer The pain decreases when he changes positions and sometimes when he walks Mr Abc reports that he occasionally takes 800 mg doses of ibuprofen He reported he went to physical therapy treatment on two occasions which helped for a few hours only He did report that he had a previous history of transitory low back pain During the visit he completed a modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire and a WC PI Subjective Complaint Form He listed complaints of mid and low back pain of a sore and aching character He rated the pain at grade 3 5 10 in intensity He reported difficulty with sitting at a table bending forward or stooping He reported that the pain was moderate and comes and goes During the visit at the Chiropractic Wellness Center a spinal examination form was completed It documents palpation tenderness in the cervical thoracic and lumbar spine area and also palpation tenderness present in the suboccipital area scalenes and trapezia Active cervical range of motion measured with goniometry reveals pain and restriction in all planes Active thoracic range of motion measured with inclinometry revealed pain and restriction in rotation bilaterally Active lumbosacral range of motion measured with inclinometry reveals pain with lumbar extension right lateral flexion and left lateral flexion December 11 2000 He received chiropractic manipulation treatment and he was advised to return for further treatment at a frequency of twice a week December 13 2000 He returned to the Chiropractic Wellness Center to see Joe Smith DC and it is documented that his middle back was better December 13 2000 A personal injury patient history form is completed at the Chiropractic Wellness Center Mr Abc reported that on October 4 2000 he was driving his 1996 Volvo 850 vehicle wearing seat and shoulder belt safety harnesses and completely stopped He was rear ended by a vehicle traveling at approximately 30 miles per hour The impact threw him back into his seat and he felt back pain and determined that it was not wise to move about He reported approximate damage to his vehicle of 4800 He reported continuing mid and low back pain of a dull and semi intense nature He reported that he was an export company manager for IBIKEN USA and that he missed two full days of work and missed 10 plus partial days of work He stated that he was treated initially after the motor vehicle accident at Kaiser and received painkillers and ibuprofen which relieved the pain temporarily He specifically denied ever experiencing similar symptoms December 26 2000 A no show was documented at the Chiropractic Wellness Center April 5 2001 He received treatment at the Chiropractic Wellness Center He reported that two weeks previously his mid back pain had worsened April 12 2001 He received chiropractic treatment at the Chiropractic Wellness Center April 16 2001 He did not show up for his chiropractic treatment April 19 2001 He did not show up for his chiropractic treatment April 26 2001 He received chiropractic manipulation treatment at the Chiropractic Wellness Center He reported that his mid back pain increased with sitting at the computer At the conclusion of this visit he was advised to return to the clinic as needed September 6 2002 An MRI of the thoracic spine was completed at ABCD Hospital and read by Dr RL radiologist Dr D noted the presence of minor anterior compression of some mid thoracic vertebrae of indeterminate age resulting in some increased kyphosis Some of the mid thoracic discs demonstrate findings consistent with degenerative disc disease without a significant posterior disc bulging or disc herniation There are some vertebral end plate abnormalities consistent with small Schmorl s nodes one on the superior aspect of T7 which is compressed anteriorly and on the inferior aspect of T6 May 12 2003 He was seen at the Outpatient Clinic by Dr L internal medicine specialist He was there for a health screening examination and listed that his only complaints are for psoriasis and chronic mid back pain which have been present since a 2000 motor vehicle accident Mr Abc reported that an outside MRI showed compression fractures in the thoracic spine The history further documents that Mr Abc is an avid skier and volunteers on the ski patrol The physical examination revealed that he was a middle aged Caucasian male in no acute distress The diagnosis listed from this visit is back pain and psoriasis Dr L documented that he spent one hour in the examination room with the patient discussing what was realistic and reasonable with regard to screening testing Dr L also stated that since Mr Abc was experiencing chronic back pain he advised him to see a physiatrist for evaluation He was instructed to bring the MRI to the visit with that practitioner June 10 2003 He was seen at the Physiatry Clinic by Dr R physiatrist The complaint listed is mid back pain In the subjective portion of the chart note Dr R notes that Mr Abc is involved in the import export business and that he is physically active in cycling skiing and gardening He is referred by Dr L because of persistent lower thoracic pain following a motor vehicle accident on October 4 2000 Mr Abc told Dr R that he was the restrained passenger of a vehicle that was rear ended at a moderate speed He stated that he experienced immediate discomfort in his thoracic spine area without radiation He further stated that thoracic spine x rays were obtained at the Sunnyside Emergency Room and read as normal It is noted that Mr Abc was treated conservatively and then referred to physical therapy where he had a number of visits in late of 2002 and early 2003 No further chart entries were documented about the back problem until Mr Abc complained to Dr L that he still had ongoing thoracic spine pain during a visit the previous month He obtained an MRI out of pocket at ABCD Hospital and stated that he paid 1100 for it Dr R asked to see the MRI and was told by Mr Abc that he would have to reimburse or pay him 1100 first He then told the doctor that the interpretation was that he had a T7 and T8 compression fracture Mr Abc reported his improvement at about 20 compared to how he felt immediately after the accident He described that his only symptoms are an aching pain that occurs after sitting for four to five hours If he takes a break from sitting and walks around his symptoms resolve He is noted to be able to bike ski and be active in his garden without any symptoms at all He denied upper extremity radicular symptoms He denied lower extremity weakness or discoordination He also denied bowel or bladder control or sensation issues Dr R noted that Mr Abc was hostile about the Kaiser health plan and was quite uncommunicative only reluctantly revealing his history The physical examination revealed that he moved about the examination room without difficulty and exhibited normal lumbosacral range of motion There was normal thoracic spine motion with good chest expansion Neurovascular examination of the upper extremities was recorded as normal There was no spasticity in the lower extremities There was no tenderness to palpation or percussion up and down the thoracic spine Dr R reviewed the thoracic spine films and noted the presence of a little compression of what appears to be T7 and T8 on the lateral view Dr R observed that this was not noted on the original x ray interpretation He further stated that the MRI as noted above was not available for review Dr R assessed that Mr Abc was experiencing minimal thoracic spine complaints that probably related to the motor vehicle accident three years previously The doctor further stated that the patient s symptoms are so mild as to almost not warrant intervention He discussed the need to make sure that Mr Abc s workstation was ergonomic and that Mr Abc could pursue core strengthening He further recommended that Mr Abc look into participation in a Pilates class Mr Abc was insistent so Dr R made plans to order a bone scan to further discriminate the etiology of his symptoms He advised Mr Abc that the bone scan results would probably not change treatment As a result of this visit Dr R diagnosed thoracic spine pain 724 1 and ordered a bone scan

fifth metatarsal 2 Application of short leg splint ANESTHESIA TIVA local HISTORY This 32 year old female presents to Preoperative Holding Area after keeping herself n p o since mid night for open reduction and internal fixation of a fractured right fifth metatarsal The patient relates that approximately in mid June that she was working as a machinist at Detroit Diesel and dropped a large set of tools on her right foot She continued to walk on the foot and found nothing was wrong despite the pain She was recently seen by Dr X and was referred to Dr Y for surgery The risks versus benefits of the procedure had been explained to the patient in detail by Dr Y The consent is available on the chart for review The urine beta was taken in the preoperative area and was negative PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position A safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia a total of 10 cc of 0 5 Marcaine plain was used to perform an infiltrative type block to the right fifth metatarsal area of the right foot Next the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg The foot was lowered in the operative field and a sterile stocking was reflected Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal base The Xi scan and fluoroscopic unit was used to visualize the fractured fifth metatarsal An avulsion fracture of the right fifth metatarsal base was visualized The fracture was linear in nature from distal lateral to proximal medial There appeared to be a pseudoarthrosis on the lateral view A skin scrub was used to carefully mark out all the landmarks including the peroneus longus and brevis tendons in the fifth metatarsal and the sural nerve A linear incision was created with a 10 blade A 15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue All small veins traversing the subcutaneous tissue were ligated with electrocautery Next using combination of sharp and blunt dissection the deep fascia was reached Next a linear capsuloperiosteal incision was made down to the bone using a 15 blade Next using a periosteal elevator and a 15 blade the capsuloperiosteal tissues were stripped from the bone The fracture site was not clearly visualized due to bony callus A 25 gauge needle was introduced into the fracture site under fluoroscopy The fracture site was easily found An osteotome was used to separate the pseudoarthrosis A curette was used to remove the hypertrophic excessive pseudoarthrotic bone Next a small ball burr was used to resect the remaining hypertrophic bone Next a 1 0 drill bit was used to drill the subchondral bone on either side of the fracture site and a good healthy bleeding bone Next a bone clamp was applied and the fracture was reduced Next a threaded K wire

Complete placenta manually extracted intact with three vessel cord Extensive anterior abdominal wall adhesions with the anterior abdominal wall completely adhered to the anterior uterus throughout its entire length of the incision In addition the bladder was involved in adhesion mass complex A window was developed surgically at the apical aspect of the incision enabling finger to pass to get behind the dense anterior abdominal wall adhesions These adhesions were surgically transected using Bovie cautery technique freeing up the anterior uterine attachment from the anterior abdominal wall Upon initial entry through the fibrous layer of the anterior abdominal wall into the serosal and slightly muscular part of the anterior uterus due to the dense adhesion attachment that had occurred from previous surgeries Bilateral tubal ligation performed without difficulty via Parkland technique ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS 500 mL COMPLICATIONS None URINE OUTPUT Per anesthesia records Urine cleared postoperatively IV FLUIDS Per anesthesia records The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition with stable vital signs OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE The patient was placed in a supine position after spinal epidural anesthesia She was prepped and draped in the usual manner for repeat cesarean section A sharp knife was used to make a Pfannenstiel skin incision at the site of the previous scar This was carried through the subcutaneous tissue into the dense fibromuscular and fascial layer with a sharp knife This incision was extended laterally with Mayo scissors Dense fibromuscular layer was encountered from the patient s previous surgeries Upon entry incision was entered into the serosal and partial muscular layer of the anterior uterus and there was no free area to enter into the peritoneal cavity due to dense fibromuscular adhesions of the entire uterus to the anterior abdominal wall at the length of the incision Fascia was previously separated superiorly and inferiorly from the muscular layer A surgical window was created at the apical aspect of the incision in the direction of the uterine fundus Finger was able to be passed and placed behind the dense adhesions between the uterus through anterior abdominal wall This adhesion complex was transacted via Bovie cautery its entire length circumferentially freeing the uterus from its attachment to anterior abdominal wall Inferiorly difficulty was encountered with adhesion separation involving the bladder additionally to the uterus and the anterior abdominal wall These adhesions likewise were surgically transacted via sharp blunt and electrocautery dissection This was successfully done without anterior entry into the bladder Smooth pickups and Metzenbaum scissors were then used to do sharp dissection to separated the bladder from its attachment to the lower uterine segment enabling the vesicouterine peritoneal reflection for incision of the uterus The uterus was then incised using a sharp knife and low transverse incision This was extended with bandage scissors The infant was delivered easily from a cephalic presentation Bulb suction was done following

dry lap used to remove the remaining membranous tissue from the lining Pennington clamps placed at the uterine incision angles and the inferior incision lip A 1 chromic suture closed the uterus in running continuous interlocking closure Good hemostasis upon completion of the closure Laparotomy pads placed in the posterior cul de sac to remove any blood or clots The uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity after using 1 chromic suture to close the anterior uterine incision that was partial thickness through the serosal end of the muscular layer at midline adhesion This was closed with chromic suture in a running continuous interlocking closure with good hemostasis Attention was then focused on the bilateral tubal ligation Babcock clamp placed in the mid fallopian tube and elevated Cautery was used to make a window in the avascular segment of the mesosalpinx Proximal and distal 1 chromic suture ligation with mid fallopian tube transection performed The ligated proximal and distal stumps were then cauterized with Bovie cautery This tubal ligation procedure was done in a bilateral fashion Upon completion of tubal ligation uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity Left

"Health1909","Mr XYZ forgot his hearing aids at home today and is severely hearing impaired and most of the interview had to be conducted with me yelling at him at the top of my voice For all these reasons this was not really under the best circumstances and I had to curtail the amount of time I spent trying to get a history because of the physical effort required in extracting information from this patient The patient was seen late because he had not filled in the patient questionnaire To summarize the history here Mr XYZ who is not very clear on events from the past sustained a work related injury some time in 1998 At that time he was driving an 18 wheeler truck The patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicles to his trailer He experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later underwent a fusion of L4 L5 and L5 S1 The patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery which was done somewhere in Florida by a surgeon who he does not remember He was able to return to his usual occupation but then again had a second work related injury in May of 2005 At that time he was required to boat trucks to his rig and also to use a chain pulley system to raise and lower the vehicles Mr XYZ felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital He was MRI ed at that time which apparently showed a re herniation of an L5 S1 disc and then he somehow ended up in Houston where he underwent fusion by Dr W from L3 through S2 This was done on 12 15 2005 Initially he did fairly well and was able to walk and move around but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe left sided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot He is still complaining of the severe pain right now with tingling in the medial two toes of the foot and significant weakness in his left leg The patient was referred to Dr A pain management specialist and Dr A has maintained him on opioid medications consisting of Norco 10 325 mg for breakthrough pain and oxycodone 30 mg t i d with Lunesta 3 mg q h s for sleep Carisoprodol 350 mg t i d and Lyrica 100 mg q daily The patient states that he is experiencing no side effects from medications and takes medications as required He has apparently been drug screened and his drug screening has been found to be normal The patient underwent an extensive behavioral evaluation on 05 22 06 by TIR Rehab Center At that time it was felt that Mr XYZ showed a degree of moderate level of depression There were no indications in the evaluation that Mr XYZ showed any addictive or noncompliant type behaviors It was felt at that time that Mr XYZ would benefit from a brief period of individual psychotherapy and a course of psychotropic medications Of concern to the therapist at that time was the patient s untreated and unmonitored hypertension and diabetes Mr XYZ indicated at that time they had not purchased any prescription medications or any of these health related issues because of financial limitations He still apparently is not under really good treatment for either of these conditions and on today s evaluation he actually denies that he had diabetes The impression was that the patient had axis IV diagnosis of chronic functional limitations financial loss and low losses with no axis III diagnosis This was done by Rhonda Ackerman Ph D a psychologist It was also suggested at that time that the patient should quit smoking Despite these evaluations Mr XYZ really did not get involved in psychotherapy and there was poor attendance of these visits there was no clearance given for any surgical interventions and it was felt that the patient has benefited from the use of SSRIs Of concern in June of 2006 was that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warnings His hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient was assessed at significant risk for additional health complications including stroke reduced mental clarity and future falls It was felt that any surgical interventions should be put on hold at that time In September of 2006 the patient was evaluated at Baylor College of Medicine in the Occupational Health Program The evaluation was done by a physician at that time whose report is clearly documented in the record Evaluation was done by Dr B At present Mr XYZ continues on with his oxycodone and Norco These were prescribed by Dr A two and a half weeks ago and the patient states that he has enough medication left to last him for about another two and a half weeks The patient states that there has been no recent change in either the severity or the distribution of his pain He is unable to sleep because of pain and his activities of daily living are severely limited He spends most of his day lying on the floor watching TV and occasionally will walk a while from detailed questioning shows that his activities of daily living are practically zero The patient denies smoking at this time He denies alcohol use or aberrant drug use He obtains no pain medications from no other sources Review of

"Health1910","SUMMARY OF CLINICAL HISTORY The patient was a 35 year old African American male with no significant past medical history who called EMS with shortness of breath and chest pain Upon EMS arrival patient was tachypneic at 40 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation of 90 At the scene EMS administered breathing treatments and checked lung sounds that did not reveal any evidence of fluid in the lung fields EMS also reports patient was agitated upon their arrival at his residence Two minutes after arrival at UTMB at 1500 the patient became unresponsive apneic and had oxygen saturations from 80 90 The patient s heart rate decreased to asystole was intubated with good breath sounds and air movement Patient then had wide complex bradycardia and ACLS protocol for pulseless electrical activity was followed for 45 minutes The patient was administered TPA with no improvement Bedside echocardiogram showed no pericardial effusion The patient was administered D5W Narcan and multiple rounds of epinephrine and atropine calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate The patient had three episodes of ventricular tachycardia fibrillation with cardioversion defibrillation resulting in asystole The patient was pronounced dead at 1605 with fixed dilated pupils no heart sounds no pulse and no spontaneous respirations DESCRIPTION OF GROSS LESIONS EXTERNAL EXAMINATION The body is

pericardial sac is yellow glistening without adhesions or fibrosis and contains 30 ml of a straw colored fluid There is minimal fluid in the peritoneal cavity HEART The heart is large with a normal shape and a weight of 400 grams The pericardium is intact The epicardial fat is diffusely firm As patient was greater than 48 hours post mortem no TTC staining was utilized Upon opening the heart was grossly normal without evidence of infarction There were slightly raised white plaques in the left ventricle wall lining The left ventricle measures 2 2 cm the right ventricle measures 0 2 cm the tricuspid ring measures 11 cm the pulmonic right measures 8 cm the mitral ring measures 10 2 cm and the aortic ring measures 7 cm The foramen ovale is closed The circulation is left dominant Examination of the great vessels of the heart reveals minimal atherosclerosis with the area of greatest stenosis 20 stenosis at the bifurcation of the LAD AORTA There is minimal atherosclerosis with no measurable plaques along the full length of the ascending and descending aorta LUNGS The right lung weighed 630 grams the left weighed 710 grams The lung parenchyma is pink without evidence of congestion of hemorrhage The bronchi are grossly normal In the right lung there are two large organizing thrombo emboli The first is located at the first branch of the pulmonary artery with an older organizing area adherent to the vessel wall measuring 1 0 x 1 0 x 2 5 cm Surrounding this organizing area is a newer area of apparent thrombosis completely occluding the bifurcation The other large organizing adherent embolus is located further in out in the vasculature measuring approximately 1 0 x 1 0 x 1 5 cm There are multiple other emboli located in smaller pulmonary vessels that show evidence of distending the vessels they are located inside GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM The esophagus and stomach are normal in appearance without evidence of ulcers or varices The stomach contains approximately 800 ml without evidence of any pills or other non foodstuff material The pancreas shows a normal lobular cut surface with evidence of autolysis The duodenum ileum jejunum and colon are all grossly normal without evidence of abnormal vasculature or diverticula An appendix is present and is unremarkable The liver weighs 2850 grams and the cut surface reveals a normal liver with no fibrosis present grossly The gallbladder is in place with a probe patent bile duct through to the ampulla of Vater RETICULOENDOTHELIAL SYSTEM The spleen is large weighing 340 grams the cut surface reveals a normal appearing white and red pulp No abnormally large lymph nodes were noted GENITOURINARY SYSTEM The right kidney weighs 200 grams the left weighs 210 grams The left kidney contains a 1 0 x 1 0 x 1 0 simple cyst containing a clear fluid The cut surface reveals a normal appearing cortex and medulla with intact calyces The prostate and seminal vessels were cut revealing normal appearing prostate and seminal vesicle tissue without evidence of inflammation or embolus ENDOCRINE SYSTEM The adrenal glands are in the normal position and weigh 8 0 grams on the right and 11 6 grams on the left The cut surface of the adrenal glands reveals a normal appearing cortex and medulla The thyroid gland weighs 12 4 grams and is grossly normal EXTREMITIES Both legs and calves were measured and found to be very similar in circumference Both legs were also milked and produced no clots in the venous system CLINICOPATHOLOGIC CORRELATION This patient died shortly after a previous pulmonary embolus completely occluded the right pulmonary artery vasculature The most significant finding on autopsy was the presence of multiple old and new thromboemboli in the pulmonary vasculature of the right lung The autopsy revealed evidence of multiple emboli in the right lung that were at least a few days old because the emboli that were organizing were adherent to the vessel wall In order to be adherent to the vessel wall the emboli must be in place long enough to evoke a fibroblast response which takes at least a few days The fatal event was not the old emboli in the right lung but rather the thrombosis on top of the large saddle thrombus residing in the pulmonary artery This created a high pressure situation that the right ventricle could not handle resulting in cardiac dysfunction and ultimately the patient s demise Although this case is fairly straight forward in terms of what caused the terminal event perhaps the more interesting question is why a relatively healthy 35 year old man would develop a fatal pulmonary embolism Virchow s triad suggests we should investigate endothelial injury stasis and a hypercoagulable state as possible etiologies The age of the patient probably precludes venous stasis as the sole reason for the embolus although it could have certainly contributed The autopsy revealed no evidence of endothelial damage in the pulmonary vasculature that would have caused the occlusion The next logical reason would be a hypercoagulable state Some possibilities include obesity trauma surgery cancer Factor V Leiden deficiency as well as other inherited disorders prothrombin gene mutation deficiencies in protein C protein S or antithrombin III and disorders of plasminogen and Lupus anticoagulant Of these risks factors obesity was the only risk factor the patient was known to have The patient had no evidence of trauma surgery cancer or the stigmata of SLE therefore these are unlikely Perhaps the most fruitful search would be an examination of the genetic possibilities for a hypercoagulable state Factor V Leiden being the most common In summary this patient died of a pulmonary embolism the underlying cause of which is currently undetermined A definitive diagnosis may be ascertained with either genetic or other laboratory tests and a more detailed history SUMMARY AND REFLECTION WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS AUTOPSY I learned that although a cause of death may sometimes be obvious the underlying mechanism for the death may still be elusive This patient was an otherwise completely healthy 35 year old man with one known risk factor for a hypercoagulable state REMAINING UNANSWERED QUESTIONS Basically the cause of the hypercoagulable state is undetermined Once that question is answered I believe this autopsy will have done a great service for the patient s family"

down The deltoid was retracted laterally The clavicular head of the pectoralis major was noted to be intact with the absence of the sternal insertion There was a small cuff of tissue left on the proximal humerus associated with the clavicular head Gentle probing medially revealed the end of the sternal retracted portion traction sutures of 5 Ethibond were used in this to allow for retraction and freeing from light adhesion This allowed reapproximation of the retracted tendon to the tendon stump At this point a repair using 5 FiberWire was then performed of the pectoralis major tendon back to stump on the proximal humerus noting good apposition of the tendon edges and no gapping of the repair site At this point a single metal suture anchor was attempted to be implanted just lateral to the insertion of the pectoralis in order to remove tension off the repair site however the inserted device attached to the metal anchor broke during insertion due to significant hardness of the bone For this reason the starting hole was tapped and a 5x5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed doubly loaded The sutures were then weaved through the lateral aspect of the torn tendon and a modified Krackow type performed and sutured thereby relieving tension off the soft tissue repair At this point there was noted to be excellent apposition of the soft tissue ends and a solid repair to gentle manipulation Aggressive external rotation was not performed The wound was then copiously irrigated The cephalic vein was not injured during the case The skin was then closed using a 2 0 Vicryl followed by a 3 0 subcuticular Prolene suture with Steri Strips Sterile dressing was then placed Anesthesia was then performed interscalene block The patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transported to postanesthesia care in stable condition in a shoulder immobilizer with the arm adducted and internally rotated Plan for this patient the patient will remain in the shoulder immobilizer until followup visit in approximately 10 days We will then start a gentle Codman type exercises and having limited motion until the 4 6 week point based on the patient s progression"

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES Multiple metastatic lesions to the brain a subtentorial lesion on the left greater than 3 cm and an infratentorial lesion on the right greater than 3 cm TITLE OF THE OPERATION 1 Biparietal craniotomy and excision of left parietooccipital metastasis from breast cancer 2 Insertion of left lateral ventriculostomy under Stealth stereotactic guidance 3 Right suboccipital craniectomy and excision of tumor 4 Microtechniques for all the above 5 Stealth stereotactic guidance for all of the above and intraoperative ultrasound INDICATIONS The patient is a 48 year old woman with a diagnosis of breast cancer made five years ago A year ago she was diagnosed with cranial metastases and underwent whole brain radiation She recently has deteriorated such that she came to my office unable to ambulate in a wheelchair Metastatic workup does reveal multiple bone metastases but no spinal cord compression She had a consult with Radiation Oncology that decided they could radiate her metastases less than 3 cm with stereotactic radiosurgery but the lesions greater than 3 cm needed to be removed Consequently this operation is performed PROCEDURE IN DETAIL The patient underwent a planning MRI scan with Stealth protocol She was brought to the operating room with fiducial still on her scalp General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained She was placed on the Mayfield head holder and rolled into the prone position She was well padded secured and so forth The neck was flexed so as to expose the right suboccipital region as well as the left and right parietooccipital regions The posterior aspect of the calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine soak scrub followed by Betadine paint This was done only of course after fiducial were registered in planning and an excellent accuracy was obtained with the Stealth system Sterile drapes were applied and the accuracy of the system was confirmed A biparietal incision was performed A linear incision was chosen so as to increase her chances of successful wound healing and that she is status post whole brain radiation A biparietal craniotomy was carried out carrying about 1 cm over toward the right side and about 4 cm over to the left side as guided by the Stealth stereotactic system The dura was opened and reflected back to the midline An inner hemispheric approach was used to reach the very large metastatic tumor This was very delicate removing the tumor and the co surgeons switched off to spare one another during the more delicate parts of the operation to remove the tumor The tumor was wrapped around and included the choroidal vessels At least one choroidal vessel was sacrificed in order to obtain a gross total excision of the tumor on the parietal occipital region Bleeding was quite vigorous in some of the arteries and finally however was completely controlled Complete removal of the tumor was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound Once the tumor had been removed and meticulous hemostasis was obtained this wound was left opened and attention was turned to the right suboccipital area A linear incision was made just lateral to the greater occipital nerve Sharp dissection was carried down in the subcutaneous tissues and Bovie electrocautery was used to reach the skull A burr hole was placed down low using a craniotome A craniotomy was turned and then enlarged as a craniectomy to at least 4 cm in diameter It was carried caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus Stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that was within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum The ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor and this was draining CSF relieving pressure in the posterior fossa Upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region the brain was noted to be extremely tight thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomy At the posterior fossa a corticectomy was accomplished and the tumor was countered directly The tumor as the one above was removed both piecemeal and with intraoperative Cavitron Ultrasonic Aspirator A gross total excision of this tumor was obtained as well I then explored underneath the cerebellum in hopes of finding another metastasis in the CP angle however this was just over the lower cranial nerves and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscles and voice as well as possibly hearing loss this lesion was left alone and to be radiated and that it is less than 3 cm in diameter Meticulous hemostasis was obtained for this wound as well The posterior fossa wound was then closed in layers The dura was closed with interrupted and running mattress of 4 0 Nurolon The dura was watertight and it was covered with blue glue Gelfoam was placed over the dural closure Then the muscle and fascia were closed in individual layers using 0 Ethibond Subcutaneous was closed with interrupted inverted 2 0 and 0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with running locking 3 0 Nylon For the cranial incision the ventriculostomy was brought out through a separate stab wound The bone flap was brought on to the field The dura was closed with running and interrupted 4 0 Nurolon At the beginning of the case dural tack ups had been made and these were still in place The sinuses both the transverse sinus and sagittal sinus were covered with thrombin soaked Gelfoam to take care of any small bleeding areas in the sinuses Once the dura was closed the bone flap was returned to the wound and held in place with the Lorenz microplates The wound was then closed in layers The galea was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 2 0 Vicryl The skin was closed with a running locking 3 0 Nylon Estimated blood loss for the case was more than 1 L The patient received 2 units of packed red cells during the case as well as more than 1 L of Hespan and almost 3 L of crystalloid Nevertheless her vitals remained stable throughout the case and we hopefully helped her survival and her long term neurologic status for this really nice lady"

dictated separately But essentially this is a pleasant 72 year old woman admitted to the hospital with a large right MCA CVA causing a left sided neurological deficit incidentally found to have atrial fibrillation on telemetry She has been recommended for a transesophageal echocardiogram for cardioembolic source of her CNS insult I discussed the procedure in detail with the patient as well as with her daughter who was present at the patient s bedside with the patient s verbal consent I then performed a risk benefit alternative analysis with benefits being more definitive exclusion of intracardiac thrombus as well as assessment for intracardiac shunts alternatives being transthoracic echo imaging which she had already had with an inherent false negativity for this indication as well as empiric medical management which the patient was not interested in risks including but not limited to and the patient was aware this was not an all inclusive list of oversedation from conscious sedation risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents risk of oropharyngeal esophageal oral tracheal pulmonary and or gastric perforation hemorrhage or tear The patient expressed understanding of this risk benefit alternative analysis had the opportunity to ask questions which I invited from her and her daughter all of which were answered to their self stated satisfaction The patient then stated in a clear competent and coherent fashion that she wished to go forward with the transesophageal echocardiogram PROCEDURE The appropriate time out procedure was performed as per Medical Center protocol under my direct supervision with appropriate identification of the patient position physician procedure documentation there were no safety issues identified by staff nor myself She received 20 cc of viscous lidocaine for topical oral anesthetic effect She received a total of 4 mg of Versed and 100 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrated conscious sedation with continuous hemodynamic and oximetric monitoring with reasonable effect The multi plane probe was passed using digital guidance for several passes after an oral bite block had been put into place for protection of oral dentition This was placed into the posterior oropharynx and advanced into the esophagus then advanced into the stomach and then rotated and withdrawn and removed with adequate

BUN 49 creatinine 5 90 Troponin was 0 40 followed by 0 34 INR 1 03 on 05 18 07 White blood cell count 9 4 hematocrit 42 platelet count 139 IMPRESSION Ms ABC is a 74 year old woman admitted to the hospital with a fall and she has a history of vascular dementia so her history is somewhat unreliable it seems and she is somnolent at that time She does have chronic atrial fibrillation again documented at least present since 2007 and I found an EKG report by Dr X which shows atrial fibrillation on 08 29 07 per her report One of the questions we were asked was whether the patient would be a candidate for Coumadin Clearly given her history of small mini strokes I think Coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation but the main issue is the fall risk If not felt to be significant fall risk then I would strongly recommend Coumadin as the patient herself states that she has only fallen twice in the past year I would defer that decision to Dr Z and Dr XY who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicate RECOMMENDATIONS 1 Fall assessment as per Dr Z and Dr XY with possible PT consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk would put her on Coumadin Given her history of small strokes as documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation she does have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol 2 The patient has elevated BNP and I suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal LV function I would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis 3 Regarding this minimal troponin elevation I do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her small to moderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that has been longstanding since 2007 from what I can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade I would defer to her usual cardiologist Dr X whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification I did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 08 07 where they felt that there was some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall but it was felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal LV function seen on that study as well 4 Continue Norvasc for history of hypertension as well as labetalol 5 The patient is felt to be a significant fall risk and will at least continue her aspirin 81 mg once a day for secondary CVA thromboprophylaxis albeit

"Health1931","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is an 84 year old woman with a history of hypertension severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension mild aortic stenosis and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and I was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after a fall Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances on her driveway and on her left side hit a rock When she came to the emergency room she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s so that was stopped Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs Her potassium at that time was 3 1 She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems PAST CARDIAC HISTORY She is followed by Dr X in our office and has a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild elevation and PA pressure On 05 12 08 preserved left and right ventricular systolic function aortic sclerosis with apparent mild aortic stenosis and bi atrial enlargement She has previously had a Persantine Myoview nuclear rest stress test scan completed at ABCD Medical Center in 07 06 that was negative She has had significant mitral valve regurgitation in the past being moderate but on the most recent echocardiogram on 05 12 08 that was not felt to be significant She has a history of hypertension and EKGs in our office show normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs versus wandering atrial pacemaker She does have a history of significant hypertension in the past She has had dizzy spells and denies clearly any true syncope She has had bradycardia in the past from beta blocker therapy MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION 1 Multivitamin p o daily 2 Aspirin 325 mg once a day 3 Lisinopril 40 mg once a day 4 Felodipine 10 mg once a day 5 Klor Con 20 mEq p o b i d 6 Omeprazole 20 mg p o daily presumably for

WITH THAT IN THE PAST FAMILY HISTORY She states her brother died of an MI suddenly in his 50s SOCIAL HISTORY She does not smoke cigarettes abuse alcohol nor use any illicit drugs She is retired from Morse Chain and delivering newspapers She is widowed She lives alone but has family members who live either on her property or adjacent to it REVIEW OF SYSTEMS She denies a history of stroke cancer vomiting of blood coughing up blood bright red blood per rectum bleeding stomach ulcers She does not recall renal calculi nor cholelithiasis denies asthma emphysema pneumonia tuberculosis sleep apnea home oxygen use She does note occasional peripheral edema She is not aware of prior history of MI She denies diabetes She does have a history of GERD She notes feeling depressed at times because of

were not distended There are no carotid bruits Lungs Clear to auscultation anteriorly without wheezes She is relatively immobile because of her left hip fracture Cardiac Exam S1 S2 regular rate

beats per minute no ischemic changes She had a followup EKG done at 20 37 on 08 19 08 which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T wave changes not significantly changed from prior Followup EKG done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs IMPRESSION She is an 84 year old female with a history of hypertension severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery Telemetry now reviewed shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia which has been corrected There has been no atrial fibrillation documented I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil which has been started which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia which she had and would watch for heart rate with that Continued optimization of electrolytes The patient cannot take beta blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath although there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil The patient is aware of the cardiac risks certainly it is moderate and wishes to proceed with needed surgery I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr X after discharge Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist"

PLAN Newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer with a stage T3c N0 M0 colon cancer grade 1 She does not have high risk factors such as high grade or angiolymphatic invasion and adequate number of lymph nodes were sampled Although the tumor was near obstructing she was not having symptoms and in fact was having normal bowel movements A lengthy discussion was held with the patient regarding her diagnosis and prognosis Firstly she has a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy I would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age Referring to the database that had been online she has a 13 chance of relapse in the next five years and with aggressive chemotherapy X linked agammaglobulinemia XLA platinum based this would be reduced to an 8 risk of relapse with a 5 benefit Chemotherapy with 5 FU based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 2 5 Plan was made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discuss the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effects We did not review all that information today She has a family history of early colon cancer Her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the paternal family history if we can Tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability and we will discuss this when those results are available She has one sibling and he is up to date on colonoscopy She does report multiple tubes of blood were drawn prior to her admission I will check with Dr Y s office whether she has had a CEA and liver associated enzymes assessed If not those can be drawn tomorrow"

curettage D C 2 Laparoscopy 3 Harmonic scalpel ablation of lesion which is suspicious for endometriosis ANESTHESIA General with endotracheal tube ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Less than 20 cc COMPLICATIONS None INDICATIONS This is a 35 year old Caucasian female gravida 1 para 0 0 1 0 with a history of spontaneous abortion This patient had approximately greater than ten years of chronic pelvic pain with dysmenorrhea which has significantly affected her activities of daily living Symptoms have not improved with prescription of oral contraceptives The patient has had one prior surgery for a left ovarian cystectomy done by laparoscopy in 1996 The cyst was not diagnosed as an endometrioma The patient does desire future fertility however would like a definitive diagnosis Conservative medical therapy was offered i e Lupron or repeat oral contraceptives but declined FINDINGS Bimanual exam reveals a small retroverted uterus which is easily mobile There were no adnexal masses The cervix was normal on palpation A fibrotic band was noted at the internal os during dilation On laparoscopic exam the uterus was found to be small with mild spongy texture On palpation the right ovary and adnexa were grossly normal with no evidence of endometriosis The left ovary was grossly normal The left fallopian tube had a mild hydrosalpinx present The left uterosacral ligament had three to four 1 mm to 2 mm lesions that were vesicular in nature consistent with endometriosis The vesicouterine reflection in the anterior aspect of the uterus were within normal limits as were the posterior cul de sac The liver appeared grossly normal There were no obvious pelvic adhesions The left internal inguinal ring is somewhat patent however there is no bowel or viscera protruding through it PROCEDURE The patient was seen in the preop suite History was reviewed and all questions were answered The patient was then taken to the operative suite where she was placed under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube She was placed in a dorsal lithotomy position in Allen stirrups She was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter producing approximately 100 cc of clear yellow urine A bimanual exam was performed by Dr X Dr Y and Dr Z with above findings noted A sterile weighted speculum was placed in posterior aspect of the vagina and the anterior aspect of the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum There was an attempt to place the uterine sound through the external and internal cervical os however secondary to a fibrotic band at the internal os that was impossible A 9 dilator was allowed to remain in the cervix for minimal manipulation while attention was then turned to the abdomen An infraumbilical incision was made using skin scalpel The Veress needle was placed and CO2 was insufflated It was immediately noticed that the pressures were inconsistent with intraabdominal insufflation and the CO2 was discontinued and Veress needle was completely removed A second attempt placement of the Veress needle into the abdomen was successful and CO2 was insufflated approximately 3 liters with minimal intraabdominal pressure The 12 port was placed and the laparoscope was inserted Attention was then turned back to the uterus and with the assistance of current hemostat to bluntly dissect the fibrotic band of the internal os Successful sounding of the uterus showed an 8 cm uterus that was in a retroverted position The cervix was serially dilated using Hank dilators to allow for introduction of the sharp curette A curettage was then performed and specimen of the endometrium was sent for pathologic evaluation This procedure was performed under direct laparoscopic visualization Laparoscopic evaluation of the pelvis was performed and the above findings noted A second abdominal incision was performed suprapubically using a skin scalpel and the Veress needle was placed through the incision successfully under direct visualization A 5 port was then placed through the sheath and the uterine manipulator was used to complete visualization The manipulator was then removed and the Harmonic scalpel was placed through the 5 port The Harmonic scalpel was used then to ablate the 1 mm vesicular lesions on the left uterosacral ligament The lesions were suspect for endometriosis however they were not diagnostic of endometriosis There was also present a 3 mm to 5 mm submucosal uterine fibroid on the right lower uterine segment The Harmonic scalpel was removed from the abdomen as was the 5 port The incision was internally found to be hemostatic The laparoscope was then removed from the abdomen The abdomen was desufflated The introducer was then replaced into the 12 port and the 12 port was removed from the abdomen The uterine manipulator was removed from the uterus and the cervix was found to be hemostatic The weighted speculum was then removed The patient taken out of dorsal lithotomy position She was recovered from general anesthesia and taken to the postoperative suite for complete recovery The patient s discharge instructions will include a followup in one to two weeks
