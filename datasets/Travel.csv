"Travel00760","@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket."
"Travel00761","@united Deep Vein thrombosis"
"Travel00762","@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!"

"Travel00765","@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail"
"Travel00766","@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here."
"Travel00767","@united unfortunately still on the Tarmac at @fly2ohare and definitely missing my ride from @flypdx #GonnaBeALongNight"
"Travel00768","‚Äú@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN‚Äù I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx"
"Travel00769","@united what time does check in open for flight no UA80 from Manchester to Newark today ?"
"Travel00770","@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
"Travel00771","@united DM sent"
"Travel00772","@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit."
"Travel00773","@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."

"Travel00775","@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture"
"Travel00776","@united But thanks for asking"
"Travel00777","@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it."
"Travel00778","@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight."
"Travel00779","@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B"
"Travel00780","@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."

"Travel00782","@united you too!"
"Travel00783","@united is my favorite airline."

"Travel00797","@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United"
"Travel00798","@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement"
"Travel00799","@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"
"Travel00800","@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe"
"Travel00801","@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like"

"Travel00814","@united I hope so too"
"Travel00815","@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am."
"Travel00816","@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous."
"Travel00817","@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight."
"Travel00818","@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery"
"Travel00819","@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier."
"Travel00820","@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??"
"Travel00821","@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!"
"Travel00822","@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."
"Travel00823","@united where is my flight voucher?"
"Travel00824","@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."

"Travel00841","@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures."

"Travel00843","@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
"Travel00844","@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver."

"Travel00851","@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful."

"Travel07338","@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying"

"Travel10878","@USAirways 2133. Flight now Cancelled Flightled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I'll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA."
"Travel10879","@USAirways We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on????"

"Travel10881","@USAirways can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx"
"Travel10882","@USAirways Reservation agent on the phone did a great job."
"Travel10883","@USAirways get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes. Take a page from @Delta perhaps."

"Travel10887","@USAirways Thank you. But I don‚Äôt understand. What will you do with my feedback?"
"Travel10888","@USAirways has no idea what customer service means.  As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don't treat me like its no big deal!"
"Travel10889","@USAirways Still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. Platinum? Who cares? Problems checking in? Who cares?"

"Travel10893","@USAirways I fly quite a bit, and it's not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what's happening, arrangements can be made"
"Travel10894","@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased."
"Travel10895","@USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more)."

"Travel10912","@USAirways 835, fix this ASAP"
"Travel10913","@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care. We‚Äôre automated."""

"Travel10922","@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here"
"Travel10923","@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless."
"Travel10924","@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!"
"Travel10925","@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless."
"Travel10926",".@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again."
"Travel10927","@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!"
"Travel10928","@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!"
"Travel10929","@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service"
"Travel10930","@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate"
"Travel10931","@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout"
"Travel10932","@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response."
"Travel10933","@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice"
"Travel10934","@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on."
"Travel10935","@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable"
"Travel10936","@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail"
"Travel10937","@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous"
"Travel10938","@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight."
"Travel10939","@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open."
"Travel10940","@USAirways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! ‚õÑÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è"
"Travel10941","@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay."
"Travel10942","@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half."
"Travel10943","@USAirways Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super."
"Travel10944","@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight."
"Travel10945","@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air"
"Travel10946","@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off."

"Travel10970",".@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm."
"Travel10971","@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!"
"Travel10972","@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated"
"Travel10973","@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!"

"Travel10982","@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes"
"Travel10983","@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable."
"Travel10984","@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!"
"Travel10985","‚Äú@USAirways: @jdbwaffles We're excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?‚Äù Spring Break !!!"
"Travel10986","@USAirways still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. What's up?"
"Travel10987","@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA"
"Travel10988","@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. üëå"
"Travel10989","@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us"
"Travel10990","@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice"
"Travel10991","@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!"
"Travel10992","@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons."
"Travel10993","@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors"
"Travel10994","@USAirways I‚Äôll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/"
"Travel10995","@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks"

"Travel10999","@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."
"Travel11000","@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?"
"Travel11001","@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?"

"Travel11003","@USAirways doesn't want me to get home"
"Travel11004","@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?"

"Travel11007","@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
"Travel11008","@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful"
"Travel11009","@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge."
"Travel11010","@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays."
"Travel11011","@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta"

"Travel11018","@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect."
"Travel11019","@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused."
"Travel11020","@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!"
"Travel11021","@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??"
"Travel11022","@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!"
"Travel11023","@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home."
"Travel11024","@USAirways but it's not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?"
"Travel11025","@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded."

"Travel12383","@AmericanAir She was at gate on time though, they made her cry, and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. Plane still outside."

"Travel12397","@AmericanAir  Yes I do bit you don't follow me so I can't DM you"
